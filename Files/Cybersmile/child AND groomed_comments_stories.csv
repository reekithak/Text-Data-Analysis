10,g0mnveh,t3_i4eacd,"Some times I look at things and wonder what it would be like 20 years from now.

Everyone thought they were genius and doing something very good whenever we talked all the boy scout leaders to identify abuse.

Everyone that we were doing something great and being really smart when we taught stranger danger.

And the current culture has a strong hate towards pedophilia.  ([often too much](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/talking-about-trauma/201603/non-offending-pedophiles-suffer-isolation))

Everyone thinks they are doing good/great... But misses the point. (actually makes me think of when I worked as a locksmith and people need high security locks on their doors that have the window right next to the lock and they wanted the thumb turn on the inside)

So 20 years from now while mom's look back, they will have been looking up dolls skirts while sending the kid to the ""nice man next door"". Lives alone, on computer at 3am, never dates, has bunch kids toys.


Here was my Facebook response as I got spammed by this stupidity:

Yeah... Weird and poorly thought-out but I have a couple points;

1. Not everything ""conditions pedophilia"". Clinically it doesn't even make sense. But, the sheer number of people that instantly think this way does disturb me. Like why are THEY so focused on pedophilia?

2. It's not a push button. It's a contact button for when the doll seats to elicit a reaction upon rooting.
A) apparently these parents don't know the difference between genitals and perineum
B) why is the parent indoor children already exploring up the skirt? We could say we're already teaching pedophilia then... ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
C) even as a kid I need the distinct difference between a contact button any button I meant to press... WTF, this lady is a parent?

3. I went and listened to The sounds. She's never had sex. 

4. Checked the lore. Poppy is an adult. At least 20 years old.

5. Yeah but ignore that poppy is a flower used as a symbol for sleep and death, it's where opium comes from etc. 

This is why kids get kidnapped. Reminds me of the old parable of the steamboats in the multiple workers... Short last guy uses this little toy hammer and taps. It's not about the amount of effort but where you apply it.

Remember when we trained boy scout leaders to recognize abuse? üò¨
And when stranger danger made kids to scared to tell police/counselor etc that a relative/close family friend (95% cases) was doing bad?

Adults need stop trying. The drastic drop in grades during home schooling makes it clear they really don't know anything.

For those actually curious on pedophilia normal attraction ranges and why the age of consent laws were established linky;
https://watchdocumentaries.com/are-all-men-pedophiles/

And btw best tactic; parent.

You can't keep an eye on every kid but they all have eyes and tend to tell each other things. Let them know what's up, what to look for, how to report and communicate not just for them but their friends. And listen to what they say to you.

It's about where you apply the effort",t3_i4eacd

18,g0vt30s,t1_g0mnveh,"first off.. most moms aren't going send ""the kid to the nice man next door"". I'm totally unsure of where you have conjured up this ridiculous logic and have furthermore attempted to apply it to justification for why things may be worse 20 years from now.

something strongly indicates to me that you are not a parent and if you are, there is serious cause for concern. 

what quantifies ""often too much"" hate for pedophilia? and honestly, what the eff does that even mean? in my humble opinion, considering rampant child trafficking, a need for a show like ""to catch a predator"", fbi pedophile stings and busting huge organized movements to conceal child abuse and pedophilia, I'd say there's not enough damn hate for the abhorrent topic.

when you say ""not everything conditions pedophilia"" you are deeply missing the point. we're not worried about conditioning pedophiles with this doll. the concern is that children are being conditioned to normalize inappropriate touches and contact. why would a child need a doll that reacts in a cute and silly way when touched between its legs? think about it. these are children and what they see is what they mimic. if someone decides to touch them between their legs, perhaps they should just giggle and laugh it off like queen poppy. it's not a laughing matter and it's not something that should be promoted. 

I know people are getting up in arms about it just being a doll, but it's not. what this mother is trying to point out is that this is just one in the many other ways society is trying to normalize something so deplorable. go check out the equality act and see if you think it's just a doll. pedophilia and child sexualization should never be normalized. they should never be ok.",t3_i4eacd

Depending on which company is running the course, they can get pretty grim - the previous school I was at just told you all the ways that teachers have abused kids in the past, with a generic ""So don't do any of that shit"" at the end.

I've certainly never noticed any suspicion or similar from female staff at the school. In fact, most of them seem to have my best interests at heart. Most of the teachers are aware that they shouldn't schedule time with me where I'd be alone with a student, and always arrange to either be there themselves as well, or to have another staff member (or other students) there too. Being alone with another student in a dark room (studio space) is a big no-no, obviously.

Other steps taken are to be hyper-vigilant about your conduct around the students, and to report anything that may be able to be seen as suspicious. No touching (obviously!!!), no comments about appearance, being over-complimentary or friendly beyond the point of professionalism. None of it is really male-staff specific, but the reality is that we DO have to be much more careful.

116,g34ag0q,t1_g3478r5,"My opinion on the method is, if it's fairly clear it's possibly a honeypot/trap, and the victim still goes ahead, they clearly would have done the wrong thing in a real scenario, which is not the kind of person you can afford to have in charge. Sure, maybe you can bait way more people into committing a crime than the number of people who would normally commit it - but that's exactly the problem, and if it shown that a large number of people take the bait then it becomes clear there is a systematic issue with the kinds of people who are in charge.
In my mind, the only problem that arises with honeypots is when you incentivise someone with something outside what's inherent to the crime. For instance, if you bait someone to hack a target by offering them hundreds of thousands of dollars, it's now partially on you that they did what they did, and therefore arguing that the criminal did what they did because of their own flaws falls apart. But it is definitely your own flaws if you do something with a child much younger than you, even if they drop hints, because the basis of that law is kids don't know what they're doing and can get themselves into situations of powerlessness. It's tricky because technically what the kid is doing is a crime, but it's a crime because the kids become a victim - at no point are they a perpetrator.
I know this has limits in its rigorousness. But consideration needs to be given to the difference between committing a crime because someone said it's cool and because they offered you a decade of work's worth of payment. You have to be much more criminally inclined to take up the former offer, and at some point you have to draw this line and say 'these people don't deserve to be in charge.'
You deserved a long answer cause you're obviously a cool person who cares about this stuff and what's right.",t3_ii2n47

There's a second character Illyana Rasputin (Magik). She was introduced as the younger sister of Colossus and she was like 6 or 7 years old. At one point the X-Men are doing something and Illyana fell into a portal to Hell. She spent a long time living in Hell, but for everyone else it was like 5 seconds.

No one is disputing the doll was horribly designed. We're just saying that it was an error made in earnest by people who don't see pedophilia innuendos in everything they look at. 

>Is Drag Queen Story Time on kids TV a conspiracy? 

No, there's nothing wrong with it. Grown adults reading children age-appropriate stories while their parents are present. It happens everyday at some bookstore/library. 

Is your only problem with it that the orators are trans? 

>Or Drag Queen Kids on Netflix? 

I did a bit of research and I found no ""Drag Queen Kids on Netflix."" I did, however, find one show (not a kids show) featuring a drag queen and a child going on adventures together called *AJ and the Queen*. I also see nothing wrong with this. It's a premise that's literally been recycled like a million times before. I also see a super hero show called *Super Drag* starring transgender superheroes. I think this is great. Kids with gender dysmorphia deserve people to look up to just as much as cisgendered kids do.

>How about the NHS in the UK giving puberty blockers to kids without their parents consent? 

The policy you're referring to is under review. 

Also, kids experiencing gender dysmorphia should have their concerns addressed and explored. Especially when they're older and approaching the crux of adulthood.

>The charity for trans kids, Mermaids, being contracted by schools to teach children as young as 7 about trans and telling them that if they don't fancy anyone of the opposite sex, they're trans? 

A.) I see nothing wrong with teaching kids about trans people. The only way new generations will become more accepting is if they learn more about what they don't know. 

B.) What trans person is saying that??? Have you ever met a trans person before?

>School's implementing same sex toilets and changing rooms? 

Lol have you ever been in a powder room/lavatory? They're all same sex, dummy. 

Unless you're referring to sex-neutral bathrooms which--surprise surprise-- I also find no issue with. 

>Renaming 'paedophile' to 'minor attracted person' and have it fly under the banner of LGBTQ+ and therefore a protected sexual orientation under the Equality Act in the UK? 

Wow, what a sludge of wrong. 

MAPs are not apart of the LGBTQ+ have never been claimed by the LGBTQ+ and therefore ARE NOT a sexuality. I'm American, therefore I don't know how legislature works in the UK, but in America, pedophiles are not a protected class (as if that had to be fucking stated). I assume it's the same across the pond as well. 

>Just a conspiracy. That QAnon and Pizza gate have got a lot to answer for.

First of all, that's a fragmented sentence lol. 

Second of all, no. 

Just no. 

Go through this sub or hell, even go through the qmap (ironically on a pedophile website) and find ""answers."" The only ""answers"" that QAnon has ever presented is that pedophiles and sex trafficking exists. Okay . . .? We've known that since the beginning of time. 

The rest of QAnon and pizzagate is pure speculation (and not even fact-based speculation) rooted in fear-mongering, unchecked mental illness, and toxic conservatism. I assume the same reason you were so adamant at vilifying the LGBTQ+ with every poorly-constructed sentence in your unhinged rant is the same reason why you're so attracted to QAnon and pizzagate.",t3_i68wsf

Map/clovergender/etc was a 4chan troll that they pushed to try and turn people against the LGBT movement. Its not a thing.

When they use the ""protected class"" thing for paedophiles they're mixing up a few things. The Map troll but also in certain European countries, there's legislation that puts individuals on the sex offenders register in those areas into various benefit classes. The reason is because its difficult if not impossible for certain offenders to ever get a job again because what they did is so disgusting to most normal individuals, so they give them a minimum weekly payment on which to live if they get out of prison and their crime makes finding work near impossible. That's the thing they're referencing and turning into something it's not.

if they're pretty occupied online, like, ALL the time. if you ask them things and they dance around it. basically just secrecy, i guess?



one time my brother asked to see my camera (that i'd used recently to send the groomer pix with) and i basically freaked the fuck out. he said there's ways of recovering deleted data and i freaked out even more.



i'd say just... like, be aware what they're doing. don't like, get mad about things when they're honest; they'll just want to hide things because they're afraid of getting in trouble. don't punish curiosity.



uhh if they're talking to you about people you've never met, i guess. i *literally* wrote his username on an *easter egg* and nobody questioned it. like... ok



i think once they get old enough to be somewhat unsupervised, tell them the signs. explain manipulation. like it's one thing to be curious but it's another thing for someone to suggest ""things"". basically any online multiplayer game (or even communities for non-gaming stuff) can have people who'll take advantage of others'.

TURNS OUT he was cheating on my mom and was the one who was ruining the family. I had friends turn against me for telling them what had happened and I'm glad my SO comforts me about it. It made me genuinely fucked up because for the longest time I thought love=sex. I still do at times. If my SO doesn't sleep with me, he must not love me. 

My family is kind of fucked. No money in the world can fix us and it makes me sad. I feel we were happier when we were poor and the world was harsh than with money..I always promised myself if my parents die i'll raise my brother. It's only a matter of time until he see's how they are. The moment he starts acting out or has differentiating opinions, it's gonna go down hill..Or maybe not. Maybe he'll always be perfect in their eyes (although no, my dad already berates him for the same shit I would do with the exception they dont smack him)

I'm an adult now. I know he will never touch my sibling since he always wanted a son and hates all his daughters (previous marriages). But I will never allow him near my children.

I have kind of accepted that these things have happened. But I wish both my parents would apologize and accept they fucked up. I'm glad they don't do this shit to my brother, but I just wish they would accept maybe their actions where a direct correlation of my actions. But they never will..I will always be at fault as a child with all their issues. 

Still remember when my dad told me no one would love me with self harm scars on my legs. I still struggle with self harm. I wish I didn't have to come home during the summer but COVID was at fault and I constantly feel my BF's mom doesn't like me (tried to break us up even though we are adults for a disagreement we had).

But I think what can do wonders for you is love and support, be it from friends or professionally.
Not sex, but love that you as a person can be accepted for. Not just what you bring sexually. 
To know that you‚Äôre accepted and loved by even one person can do wonders for your mental health. 

I hope one day you can realise that what they said about you isn‚Äôt true. That you can be loved and that you are beautiful in so many different ways.

I know he's a piece of shit. I sincerely hopes he dies soon which I know is horrible to say but he has been the worse by far in my life. His brother would tell me stories and I used to not believe them but I realize the sane one is my uncle. Even my mom admits he's a narcissist, but she is one as well without realizing it.

I think the more I spend away from my family the better. I am waiting for the end of july to arrive so I can go home to my SO. So far, he's the only one who's been so accepting and loving and has helped me realize the issues I deal with and urges me to seek help.

As it goes, user beicks announced at 7:40pm today (5/12) in the server's main channel several accusations against the previous owner of the server, Omanbo. These accusations include:

* He is a pedophile
* He posted porn of a 10 year-old character (not aged up)
* He flirted with minors & pressured members into uncomfortable sexual situations
* He harassed members of his own clique/friend group
* He shamed a user with suicidal thoughts and labeled him as the ""suicide boy""
* He gaslit a child who called him unattractive
* He pressured a transgender user into sending him nudes in exchange for a moderator position, which he passed off as a joke when confronted
* He created a private porn channel (discussion + images) for himself and his mods. This channel was shortly removed by Omanbo ~~before~~ **after** user Happy Staleish Year (Piping) was promoted ~~to owner role~~ **a moderator role** for unrelated reasons

beicks also advised investigations into users odnar and hamodebu50. I was unable to find much on these two users to the immediate, but I assume they're associated with Omanbo.

Note that this is all **VERY** fresh. Omanbo has yet to make a statement on the situation, so pedophile or not, let's not default to cancel culture too quickly until all information is collected and analyzed.

**TL;DR Omanbo, the previous owner of the LtP discord, is an alleged pedophile. See the discord for accusations, screenshots, and statuses.**",t3_gip6vl

She had apparently struck up a relationship with V online, and was groomed for 4 months before he gained her trust. He depicted himself as a kind and caring person, while simultaneously creating emotional dependence by threatening to withdraw affection as he pleased.

~~17 considered a child? Even the child not from Malaysia? What the overseas country age of majority? Is it wrong to give sexual talk to a 17 years old when the legal sex relationship is 16?~~ People should be exposed what sexual talk is on their 16th years of life. We already told toddlers where people can't touch and tell if anyone touching the wrong parts.

This is why sex education is important to be introduced in Malaysia. And not just teaching the biological part. But also the societal too according with the times. People should be teach what's right/wrong. Encourage these age groups to discuss sex topics more rather than keep it inside. And yes, that also includes teaching condom usage. STD is serious business.

~~OTH Malaysia has various age of majority limits.~~

~~On having sex~~

> ~~Listen up, boys and girls.The legal age to give **consent (permission) to sex is 16 years old**. Having sex with anyone younger than 16 years old, may be statutory rape even if he/she said yes. ‚Äì¬†¬†Malaysian Penal Code (Act 574), Section 375.~~

~~On marriage~~

> ~~The legal age for marriage has been a contentious issue recently. For Non-Muslims throughout Malaysia, if your parents give you permission then the legal age of marriage is 18 for men and women. However, **the age may be reduced to 16 for women** if the Chief Minister grants you a license. If your parents don‚Äôt give permission, the both of you would have to wait until the age of 21 to marry -¬†Section 12¬†Law Reform (Marriage and Divorce) Act 1976.~~

> ~~For Muslims, the laws relating to marriage age differ depending on an individual‚Äôs state¬†Islamic laws. Selangor became the first state to standardize the marriage age for Muslim men and women to 18, but **an application may be made to the Syariah court to marry if you‚Äôre¬†underage.**~~

541,f9f0kdv,t3_e4ea6m,"Answer: He's accused by about a dozen women of sexual misconduct and abuse. He tried to scam his first ex-wife by pressuring her to sign a divorce agreement (that wasn't notarized and didn't have any legal legitimacy,) out of the blue, so he could have sex with a 17 year old girl. He traveled across the country to make sure he was in a state where he could legally have sex with her, they get engaged, he abused her, forcibly shaved her head, and just acted like a total scumbag, that relationship ended, he had a few other sexual encounters with younger girls, he met his now spouse, when they found his YouTube videos at age 15 or 16, he again, went to a state where the age of consent was lower so he could have sex with her and legally marry her under 18. (He was in his mid-late 20s at this point. His spouse, who was at the time identifying as female, (they have since transitioned,) came out as bisexual, and he urged them to get a girlfriend in addition to him, his spouse started dating a girl who was around 18, and he started manipulating the relationship so that it was all three of them, and not just his spouse with both of them as they'd originally agreed to, he got really upset that the girlfriend was smoking marijuana, and sent a list of things she could do to ""make it up to them,"" including not seeing her family for a year, letting them chain her in their basement for a week, shaving her head, getting a tattoo of the word ""liar,"" among other things. She left. Around that time, his spouse met a 15 year old girl and befriended her. His spouse sent the girl nude pictures and got her to send nudes back, Onison sent shirtless picture to her, and other stuff of that nature for the following years. When she was 16 or 17, she had a problem at home and they offered her to move in with them, which she did. Onision forced her to make a video stating she had never done anything inappropriate with his spouse, (which was a lie.) They eventually assumed legal guardianship of her, and within a few weeks after she turned 18, Onision had sex with her. (There are leaked texts of Onision and his spouse arguing over her virginity like it's an object, it's pretty horrible.) He also had her sign an NDA to not talk about any of it, which again, is not actually legally binding. Since then, all these girls, along with a few others he did illicit things with that were less in the spotlight came out accusing him of all this. Chris Hansen got involved, and he has interviewed all the girls in question on his YouTube channel. He offered for Onision to come on his show to clear his name if he wanted, and Onision said he only would if he was paid a pretty absurd amount of money, then threatened to sue Chris Hansen. Since then Chris Hansen has gotten in contact with the FBI and they are, according to him, currently looking into it.

None of that is actually what got his patron removed though. He started breaking down on twitter, posting pictures of himself with his victims with quotes from videos he coerced them to make while they were still being abused, posting pictures of his critics who openly called him out, (one of them even did an interview with one of his victims about it,) and calling them sexy, all kinds of creepy stuff, a lot of very disturbing sexual stuff, and at one point, he posted screenshots of his texts with some of these people, and he posted one with the phone number of his spouse's ex-girlfriend, and patreon removed his account because they have a zero tolerance policy for doxxing.",t3_e4ea6m

543,f9bwxy0,t1_f99gnnb,"He's done a lot of awful, awful things.  Killed his pet turtle, too.

But also important - he's being investigated by the FBI thanks to Chris Hansen, who has been conducting interviews on YouTube with all of Onision's exes. Shiloh, Billie, Sarah, and there was one other girl that came forward with him IIRC. You can also follow their story by reading their Twitter pages - Shiloh's handle is Patient47245143, and from her you can find Luxymoo, Netunesa, Notsolillioness (Sarah), Billiedawnwebb, ayallahkarina, hahan0bye (Regina), and more and they all have tons of receipts. [example](https://twitter.com/notsolillioness/status/1175516785778581505?s=19).

Important note - please PLEASE don't give his channel or his videos more views!!! Please find mirrors of his videos if possible.  If you've seen his stupid fucking video ""wow"" or ""I'm sory"" please take note that he's trying to fucking Joker his way through this. You can see how plainly he's trying to pretend to be the Joker - yes, THAT joker - and some people think he may be trying to build a case for an insanity plea if this actually goes to court.  It's more stupid, childish bullshit and NOT an actual breakdown. He *wants* the attention. I don't think he has any remorse, and with behaviour like that I'd even go so far as to wonder if he thinks he's untouchable.

Please be mindful of some of the OOTL videos that are cropping up, too - many of them have been spreading some misinformation and sensationalizing some past videos.

He‚Äôs just an empty shell trying to emulate emotion, but he clearly cannot understand emotion the way most humans do so he can‚Äôt really imitate it skillfully, and no psychologist would look at that footage and go ‚Äúyeah I think he‚Äôs out of control‚Äù. I‚Äôm absolutely sure he‚Äôs never had a true feeling in his entire life. Except for maybe anger and lust. And even talking about lust, I‚Äôd define his thing more as sex addiction, honestly. 

I mean, speaking of the pet turtle, I remember watching that video and he blatantly used his pet‚Äôs death for views and wasn‚Äôt even remotely sorry about it. The same thing goes for the deer he killed. At this point I wonder how long it‚Äôs going to take before he kills someone. He feels no remorse, no empathy, nothing.

Some people say he‚Äôs a narcissist, but there might be more within. I think he‚Äôs a narcissist and a sociopath, but I‚Äôm not qualified to diagnose anyone. 

The guy‚Äôs written 3 novels too, and there‚Äôs definitely a lot of him transpiring through the pages from reviews I‚Äôve read. The one thing I can say with confidence is that he‚Äôs an abuser. 

Anyway If you want links and have time there‚Äôs a series of YouTube live-streams by Chris Hansen (of To Catch a Predator fame) thoroughly interviewing Onision‚Äôs victims, and Repzion has also been doing a really good job in chronicling Onision‚Äôs crimes with sources and screencaps. Including the legal trouble concerning the wetlands.

I know that a few weeks he had a little under 500 patrons, which are the people giving monthly donations, but idk how much the total monthly salary was from that. He was arguably a YouTube ""star"" 5-8 years ago. He had a couple viral videos, he worked with people like Shane Dawson, but for the last 3 or 4 years he has been, more than ever, somebody who's not really on anybody's mind, who tries to stir up controversy for publicity, and it worked a few times. He'd always been somewhat trying to create buzz via outrage, but that became pretty much all he did. (He had a series where people could submit pictures of themselves or their bodies and get judgements on what he thought of their appearance, and some of the girls were as young as 13-15 that he was rating, calling hot, or commenting on their bodies in just underwear. He also made over 50 videos about Eugenia Cooney and her eating disorder, despite not knowing her, and being asked by her and the people around her repeatedly. He claimed it was to help her, but he also made a ""comedy"" sketch about her being bulimic. He openly mocked mass shooting victims. There were a few other big ones.) Nowadays, the majority of his audience he had before is gone, his videos don't really get views, and when they do, the like to dislike ratio is ridiculous. It's often 90% dislikes, and he had to start disabling replies. He does still get some views, but most of those are from people who don't like him, and he doesn't get ad revenue on almost any of them, because YouTube pretty much demonitizes his videos the second they go up at this point, since the majority of them weren't really ""suitable content""",t3_e4ea6m

(At one point her filmed her having a seizure, and uploaded it online, so that's out there.) There are a few dozen other videos that are pretty damning with context that have been deleted, but since it's the internet, they're obviously out there. 

(Also, not related to that specifically, but he has also committed tax fraud, and destroyed protected wetlands, and the way he handled those were pretty horrifying too. He entered practically everything he owned as a deduction on TurboTax, then freaked out and blamed TurboTax for making him commit tax fraud, and when he destroyed the wetlands he made a GoFundMe for his fans to pay his penalties, that the state later made him take down.)",t3_e4ea6m

If we want to add to the shittyness, look into how Onision treats his kids. Some scandals such as Diapergate showcase how in the Diapergate incident he left his baby sitting in their own feces for hours because his partner left with friends to go shopping. The baby had rashes on the inside of it's legs and Onision later used the incident as fuel to claim that his partner was a terrible person and parent for leaving the baby in such a state (when he was home alone with the kids and could have changed the baby at any moment.) His ex partner also used to upload videos to a seperate channel and in many you could still hear Onision yelling at the kids as they cried.

He's changed his name several times and changed channel names to avoid controversy and to make it harder to find any evidence. Old videos of his are hard to find because he deletes them and by the time a new controversy pops up, people are too worried to search up re-uploaded videos of his old scandals.

It's interesting you bring that up, because people absolutely do assign male or female pronouns to animals, whose sex they don't know. A random squirrel someone sees hopping around their garden will be called a ""he"", just because. Same goes for people - a redditor, or a gamer is always a ""he"", even if they have a feminine username or play a female character. If someone lives in a world, where 90% of their social interaction online involves them being called a ""he"", that somehow doesn't bother anyone, but only for as long as it makes them feel bad and uncomfortable.

This is part of the problem though, isn't it? These repeat offendors *are* going through the motions and are either not being evaluated accurately before being given parole, or are simply reaching the end of a sentence that is too short and are released into the community to do more damage. 

Given your option of pretending to be reformed or staying in prison, how many offendors do you think are going to choose to stay in prison?

Cases like these are fringe cases, and should be treated as such. 

>Pursuing this line of thinking only makes life harder for everyone else and I really feel like fear is a factor being overplayed as an authority.

Genuinely asking, how does treating violent crime seriously negatively impact non-offendors?

>I mean we just let out a reoffending priest on a basis the people described in this comment would never receive. 

That case was a complicated one for many reasons, but I think it serves to highlight my point - adequate action wasn't taken against this man for many years and he abused children on multiple occasions, and enabled others to do the same. 

>There is so many hidden factors that we really cannot talk about properly. It all just becomes an argument based on ""He is dangerous"" which can be said about quite a lot of people I've come into contact over the years working in hospitality.

I don't understand the point you're trying to make around 'actions leading to worse laws' (what actions, what laws?), or 'removing rights from people who offend'; if you're talking about locking people up for committing crimes, where's the line? Do we just stop using prisons at all? Technically any punishment for crime involves removing one right or another.

>Not to mention he may be a pedophile, so what are we doing about all those pedophiles in law enforcement, intelligence, etc.

We can walk and chew gum at the same time, but you did just say (i think?) that you didn't want any more regulations to deal with criminals. If additional regulation is what it takes to remove pedophiles from positions of power, is that acceptable to you?

And while having pedophillic urges is not a crime, acting on it by consuming child pornography or assaulting children is absolutely both a choice and a crime.",t3_gdt0qa

992,dvisctt,t3_83koyt,"The girls (and I mean girls, as in female children) who are victims are often from poor, broken families. Maybe the parents have issues of their own, such as addiction. Maybe they are out at work as the household's sole earner in a very poor paying job. They are often living in abject poverty in areas where schools are underfunded and community projects simply don't exist. They are left to their own devices at the ages of 10, 11 and 12 and they often look rough, have attitude and are seen as the underclass.

As such they are ripe for grooming. At 11, 12 years old, they are given alcohol by older men who treat them like royalty and give them anything they want...which is often alcohol, drugs, clothes etc. Then after gaining their trust, they sexually abuse them. Then rape them. Then pass them on, in exchange for cash. In other words, they are groomed to be prostitutes.

On the other side of the abuse you have the abusers. In these cases, they have been British-Asian men, often of Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin, although a large proportion are British born. They live in isolated communities with little integration with other people. They are insular, work in small local businesses such as taxi companies, takeaways, small shops etc. They are semi-powerful in their community, where men are seen as being superior and dominant to women, and people who are not from their own cultural inner circle are seen as lesser. Therefore women from outside their own community are seen as fair game for sex, but younger girls in particular are easier to manipulate and groom. 

Because of the lack of contact with institutions outside of their own, much like the Catholic, Mormon, Jehova's Witness, [insert religion/cult here] abuse, they see themselves as being untouchable. The abusers have an understanding that they help each other and keep everything under wraps.

Then there's the institutions. The councils, families, social services, the police, the schools. The schools struggle to educate them because they are unruly, often don't turn up to school, and in general are a headache for the schools to keep track of. Social services are hugely underfunded and under-resourced. They are not trained to deal with such huge cases, and often work with individual households where the abuse and concerns come from the home of the children rather than external factors. The police see these tearaway girls as a scourge on society. The girls are full of bad attitude towards police and authority and this gives the police the impression that the girls are criminal, feral kids. They treat them as the perpetrators of crimes rather than as victims of abuse. There have been cases where the girls themselves have been picked up off the streets by the police for soliciting sex and the fact they are under 16 has not concerned the police to open an investigation. The police and the CPS don't view the girls as reliable witnesses in a court of law anyway, so there is no desire to bring a case against the abusers to court. The CPS seems to think that juries would naturally not believe these poor, underclass children.

All in all, it creates this perfect storm for sexual abuse against a large number of victims to be carried out by gangs. The ""police didn't want to be accused of racism"" is just an excuse. Instead read it as ""the police didn't want to be accused of staggering incompetence.""",t3_83koyt

These are the areas in which this happens. The men living there are surrounded by people of the exact same attitude, and as such the abuse continues. The class divide plays a part in  the police investigations, but without the race issues then there would be noting to investigate.

Kids in happy supportive homes are much harder to groom - for more reasons than just being missed. They'd  just tell them to fuck off.
An eleven year old in care probably has a history of being abused or neglected, feels lost and afraid. These men start by being a loving older 'boyfriend', buying them things, making them feel loved and special and giving them the care they crave. They encourage the girls to cut contact with their family and friends. Maybe ask them to move in. Then after a few weeks of that they take them to a 'party' where they're expected to let everyone abuse them. ""If you really loved me... after all I've done for you...""

Political correctness simply numbs us into inaction by putting a nice veneer over everything.  It is an insidiously aggressive form of social censorship that does nothing to bring harmony, but instead just convinces us not to talk about the issues that could potentially harm us.  It's a fake way of avoiding division amongst ourselves by pretending there are no divides - that everything is equal and equivalent and nothing is really, objectively right or wrong.  It's like burying your head in the sand to prevent the risk of having to act boldly.

Political correctness anesthetizes.  It dulls the capacity for critical thinking by making our language, and therefore our capacity for thought and argumentation, less effective.  One day we wake up and see the bodies of hundreds of victims strewn about and realize, ""Oh, shit, this was the price we paid for ignoring some basic social problems."" 

Maybe this will snap Britain out of their dopey slumber.  They're going to have to have some very hard, open, frank conversations very soon (regarding a number of ""untouchable"" issues) or they are headed for complete breakdown.  If the state won't address the issue of dead girls, pretty soon the people will do it themselves and this isn't a recipe for social cohesion.

[Example:](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/14/family-rotherham-girl-fled-country-abuse-asian-men-court-told)

>The family of a ‚Äúlovely‚Äù 13-year-old girl who claims to have been groomed for sex by Asian men in Rotherham were so afraid of her alleged abusers that they moved to Spain after their complaints to the police, social services, their MP and the home secretary went unresolved, a court has heard.

>Now 27 and a campaigner against child sexual exploitation, she claims her abusers threatened to ‚Äúgang rape‚Äù her mother if she did not submit to their sexual abuse, which took place largely in an alley behind a branch of Boots in Rotherham town centre, in a local park and in bushes near a museum, Sheffield crown court heard on Tuesday.

>She claims that Sageer Hussain, 30, first raped her behind Boots when she was 13 and later called her a ‚Äúwhite slag‚Äù when she tried and failed to stop him. She told police that the first and second time he raped her, between 1 January and 4 April 2003, he told her to scream so that his friends, waiting nearby, would know to come and watch.

>She claims that on another occasion she was driven to Rotherham‚Äôs Clifton Park by Hussain‚Äôs cousin, Mohammed Whied, who sat on the car bonnet watching while Hussain raped her inside. On a further occasion, Hussain allegedly raped her in bushes near the museum, calling her ‚Äúa big baby‚Äù when she protested, then flicking cigarette ash in her hair, Michelle Colborne QC, prosecuting, told the jury. A few days later he punched her in the face and threatened her with a crowbar and set light to an aerosol in her face, the barrister said.

>The girl told her mother what had happened and gave a statement to police alleging that various men had raped her, including Hussain. A medical examination in April 2013 recorded bruises to her thighs and bottom, but she quickly withdrew the allegations and no charges were brought. Ten years later she reported the abuse to police again, saying she had been threatened by the men at the time. ‚ÄúFor example, they threatened they would gang rape her mother. They would drive around the estate where she lived to make sure they were serious,‚Äù Colborne told the jury.

>The girl‚Äôs parents sought help from social services and the police, writing to their MP and the then home secretary, David Blunkett, who was a Sheffield MP at the time. They had a panic alarm installed in their house and eventually moved to Spain to get away, the court heard.",t3_83koyt

It's not that people view rape as okay, but they don't have a proper understanding of what rape is. We tend to dismiss victims with certain circumstances (eg. if they're seen as ""sluts"", if they're male, if they were drinking, whether we somehow empathize with the accused etc) and this is even evident in how these young girls were viewed by the state. Each individual case was dismissed because these children were seen as ""problem kids"" just doing ""bad things"" and making bad choices. Then when we look at it collectively- we see a pattern of abuse and exploitation which is far more obvious. Imagine the sheer fear of going through this, telling a figure of authority, just to be entirely dismissed and ignored- what would that make you think, as a child, about your worth and your place? So more and more victims become even more afraid to speak out- or like speaking out is only going to be more invasive, more terrifying and more traumatic than it's worth.

It's not surprising that this happens with adults and older teenagers (although it should be- sadly it's just so common that it doesn't surprise me anymore), but to see it happen with kids was a shock for me.

They plied her with vodka and class A drugs and raped her all night, they thought it was hilarious and cheered eachother when making her choke in her own vomit while orally raping her and making her unconscious. She managed to call 999 during the night.

The rapists said it was consensual and the police agreed because they said she was a known slut. The police shouted at her if she ever wastes their time again she'll be arrested for wasting police time and apologized to the rapists. As punishment she was dumped in her underwear and bare feet on the moors 2 miles outside of town in the middle of winter.

>In Sarah‚Äôs case, she is angrier at¬†the police for their apathy¬†than at her paedophilic abusers, and she says the authorities carry most of the blame for her suffering. ‚ÄúIf they were such professionals, why has it taken up to now to pull their finger out their arses and actually start doing something?,‚Äù she says.

>On one occasion, her mother showed Sarah‚Äôs mobile phone to the police and pointed at the telephone numbers for 177 adult Asian men, but the police claimed that the Data Protection Act prevented them from investigating. The police told Maggie that Sarah‚Äôs behaviour was a ‚Äúlifestyle choice‚Äù and, although they stopped the cars she was being trafficked in on several occasions, they would chat with Sarah‚Äôs attackers and showed no concern for a child travelling alone with several grown men.

>Sarah called the police herself only once - to report a particularly brutal rape - but the officer laughed and refused to investigate. After speaking for a couple of minutes on the phone, the police officer said that as several weeks had passed since the attack, there wouldn‚Äôt be any evidence and the incident was not worth looking into.

>‚ÄúA child cannot consent to anything ‚Äì they can‚Äôt consent if they want a packet of sweets or a fizzy drink. How can a child consent to sex with a 30-year-old man?‚Äù

>Sarah Wilson

>When I ask Sarah what she‚Äôd like to say to those police officers now, she is briefly frozen in anger.

>‚ÄúDrop dead. I‚Äôd tell them to drop dead,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúWhy would a 12-year-old girl have 177 numbers of fully-grown men in her phone? The police thought that if we were getting raped, we wouldn‚Äôt keep going back. But the sex and drugs were not my decision. A child cannot consent to anything ‚Äì they can‚Äôt consent if they want a packet of sweets or a fizzy drink. How can a child consent to sex with a 30-year-old man? The police just looked at us as dirty little prostitutes.‚Äù

>She‚Äôs similarly disgusted by her two social workers, who used to moan about their caseload and treated both Sarah and her mother with disdain. ‚ÄúI f*ing hate them. They‚Äôre crap, they‚Äôre crap, they‚Äôre just crap,‚Äù she says. The social workers, she claims, never showed any concern for Sarah, and acted as though they couldn‚Äôt wait for the workday to end so they wouldn‚Äôt have to think about Sarah any more.

>When Sarah was briefly moved to a care home, the staff there were fully aware of the abuse but would ask, ‚ÄúWho are you sleeping with tonight, Sarah?,‚Äù as though paedophilic rape was an acceptable norm. When Sarah was driven home by her abusers, the¬†staff would sometimes use care home funds to pay the taxi fare.

If you can actually fucking prove something like this happened, a god damn pedophile ring, who is actually gonna call you a racist? And considering the number of victims in these scandals, is that really going to be so hard to prove? For fucks sake, a guy had a child with a 14 year old girl. A simple DNA test would provide the evidence. Yet he manages to murder the entire family before the Police act. How is that even possible? 

Either the police are so fucking incompetent that they have zero clue on how to handle it (which would be fucking pathetic) or there is more going on behind the scenes. It most probably is some high ranking or high profile situation behind the scenes, which again, wouldnt be exactly something new in Britain. Wish they would get their act together and crackdown on this hard. 

EDIT: Adding something more since ive followed this topic i.e. child abuse, grooming, child/human trafficking a bit. Atleast in the case of UK, there is a definite pattern. Almost all of the children targeted are from an at risk background. You dont even need to go into detailed tackling of the issue with the British-Pakistani or any other minority community. You can just as easily work with the at risk children and the police force, if you dont want to be seen or perceived as racist. Most of the victims were already in the system. Provide more resources to them. Educate them and the police to actually how to handle something like this. Encourage and help the victims to come forward and deal with it. Train the police force to be more empathetic and how to handle sensitive issues like this. That would solve the problem without the negative connotations they seem to fear(or imply to fear).

The marginalisation of the working class has been deliberate and systemic for a long time and this is only one of the many terrible outcomes for working class individuals and our wider society. Our girls have been abandoned to predators and our boys to being uneducated, untrained and unemployable and the law is there simply to contain them, not help them or protect them.  

The working class being portrayed as scum and scroungers is a deliberate political stance to legitimise not providing social services and we have to take responsibility for what we created by voting for it and buying into that disgusting narrative.

There have been always people abusing the system. People re-uploading cat/viral videos, people using boobs as the thumbnail... YouTube now has more specific rules about who can monetise videos. (Your channel needs a certain amount of views as a whole and I think a certain amount of subscribers)

The drama bullshit has always been there tough, Trisha Paytas & Shane Dawson started as controversial/trolling channels. 

People blame the beauty community, but a couple years back Leafy/Keemstar/Onision really pushed the controversy/drama. 

My point is... this is not ‚Äúmodern drama‚Äù if anything this type of channels are struggling because YouTube is actively reducing their reach and monetisation. YouTube literally killed Leafy, making impossible for him to make any money out of the platform. 

Onision is an idiot for not being able to produce any other type of content. He wants to be the ‚Äúedgy boy‚Äù and finally his channel is dying. But up to this point he was able to stay a float by drama/beef with other youtubers.",t3_d9n33v

The speakers included Alan Craig, former leader of the UK's Christian Peoples Alliance; Carl Benjamin (aka Sargon of Akkad), a political commentator on Youtube; Jeff Wyatt, former Deputy Leader of the For Britain party; Tommy Robinson, a British activist credited with forcing the media and establishment to confront the UK child grooming scandal; Catherine Blaiklock, the founder of The Brexit Party, she was forced to resign for anti-Islamic online statements; Paster Wale Babaunde, founding pastor of World Harvest London; and Peter Mcilvenna, former national campaign manager for UKIP.

Here is their statement on men's rights: 

>INVISIBILISATION AND UNDER-ACHIEVEMENT OF BOYS
>Our boys are being left behind by a system that seems more concerned about diversity and a gender experiment than helping our kids fulfil their full potential. Family breakdown with increasing lack of contact with fathers have left many boys with no male role models. In this vacuum gangs have flourished and boys have lost interest in educational achievement. It‚Äôs time to reclaim stability, positivity and a sense of hope in our young people.",t3_fbj0eg

2. Under certian circumstances yes, take screen shots as evidence.
3. If you are both an American citizen everything will take place in U.S courts doesn't matter were it happened.
4. No it is not too late to take action, just make sure you have all your ducks in a line before taking action.

Also consider removing yourself off social media all-together, it is the causation of your problems; legal and mentally.",t3_eh0pg0
1771,fcgdcze,t3_eh0pg0,"1. Child grooming, most likely not. Possession of child pornography would be the charge most likely.

2. Unfortunately, Snapchat couldn't cooperate with Law Enforcement even if they wanted to, because Snapchat logs the micro-messages, not the actual content of the messages.

3. If you were born in the United States, and you're a United States Citizen, it'll be resolved in the US court system.  Unfortunately though, you probably don't have a case due to no evidence, unless you have *screenshots* of the pictures or *screen recording* of the videos. 

4. There's no time limit to reporting a crime, ever. But since it was a long time ago, there most likely isn't a case.

If it occured from a US airbase it is likely in US jurisdiction and will require extradition from the UK, but yes it should be a US crime.

My best advice is to act now, you might be responsible for stopping another child from being groomed.

I suspect this might be a bit of a legal grey area as OP at the time lived in the UK and taking the pictures is not a crime in the UK.

Ayalla, who knew [Onision](http://www.lifeofonion.com/index.php?title=Main_Page) from the time [Greg/Onision & his wife Taylor/Laineybot](https://www.reddit.com/r/Onision/comments/761r10/greg_and_taylor_avaroe_a_dossier/) invited her [freshly 18-year-old](http://www.lifeofonion.com/index.php?title=Billie) friend to be in a three-way relationship, did a live stream following a series of tweets.

She [spilled](https://twitter.com/ayallakarina/status/1081214357055438849) about now 18-year-old [Sarah](http://chaseagainstonision.tumblr.com/post/124649659596/taylor-and-sarah) being groomed by Greg and Lainey since around age 14-15. She was [asked](https://twitter.com/ayallakarina/status/1081440803107627008?s=21)  to keep Sarah‚Äôs identity and personal details private but I‚Äôve kept them in this post for clarity and because this information is all public.

Lane (another previous trinity possible) states that Sarah and Lainey [used to cuddle](https://twitter.com/Lane1313_/status/1081244923612090371) and how Sarah was convinced she would be the [next girl](https://twitter.com/Lane1313_/status/1081234207769276418) after Billie and how Lainey used to [walk around naked](https://twitter.com/ayallakarina/status/1081222901519564802) with Sarah around. [Sarah's cousin](https://twitter.com/keksandkikis/status/1081818175602393088) confirms some behaviors.

Another girl [released a dm](http://chaseagainstonision.tumblr.com/image/181732336741) between her and Greg trying to guilt her for not wanting to have sex with Lainey while he‚Äôs around. Another girl [discusses with a friend in screenshots](https://twitter.com/Aguri57162109/status/1081792984767549440) how Greg forced himself on her.

Lainey [admitted to Billie](https://twitter.com/ayallakarina/status/1081233549695635457) that she and Sarah used to ‚Äútalk.‚Äù There are a [lot of screenshots](https://twitter.com/Lane1313_/status/1081815589339971584) that seem to show Lainey having inappropriate behavior around this minor who was intended to be under her guardianship.

Greg is [threatening to sue](https://twitter.com/ayallakarina/status/1081289521545834496) Ayalla in a failed attempt to [silence](https://twitter.com/ayallakarina/status/1081662369711996928?s=21)  her. More young women and their parents continue to [speak out](https://twitter.com/Dee_Cayed/status/1081974377728692224). Most recently, [Shannon Taylor](https://twitter.com/HeyThereImShan/status/1081760470204338176) [speaks out](https://twitter.com/HeyThereImShan/status/1081760552140054528) on her experience with Lainey.

Onision/Greg is trying to [frame Ayalla](https://twitter.com/ayallakarina/status/1081780739375620096) after he or Sarah watched her younow livestream. He [claims](https://twitter.com/ayallakarina/status/1081717303698485252) that Ayalla wanted a relationship with Sarah. [Both he](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5JaxqPh5r0) and [Lainey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uf6ZzF76KMo&t=5138s) did live streams immediately following the one by Ayalla. There were [inconsistencies](https://twitter.com/scarylooks/status/1081779455482363904) in their stories.

Sorry, a little scatterbrained and disorganized. A lot has happened here in the past 24 hours so it's been hard to keep up. 

EDIT: Sarah has now [publicly stated](https://lolcow.farm/pt/src/1546803369225.jpeg)  she was not legally in the care of these two. This contradicts Lainey‚Äôs previous [public statement](https://youtu.be/eFQWMb3xnlA)  (around 20:25) ‚ÄúYes, I am legally Sarah's guardian, right now, currently. Her mother signed guardianship over to me, it has been notarized and I have legal custody of Sarah right now.""",t3_ad7y7x

I'm personally tired of big youtubers rugsweeping and ignoring, Thats the reason he's been getting away with this atrocious behavior for so long and still has a gaggle of sycophants ready to attack any girl they decide to throw to the wolves in order to scare them into silence. Abusers rely on darkness and silence in order to continue their abuse.

2083,edlbh4w,t1_edkhz0h,"Hes gotten one strike for his Shane documentary. Im surprised he hasn't gotten a bullying strike for the videos he's made on Eugenia Cooney; his Sims video where he pretends to be her is just straight up mean and offers nothing positive. 

I don't know if he's done enough to get his channel removed like DaddyOhFive but he gives me the same creepy vibes. Laughing at the discomfort of people and showing signs of being verbally abusive makes me worried for how he treats his kids off camera..",t3_ad7y7x

Basically he used to have this running series on his channel where he would gather photos that people submitted to his forum, and would rate their bodies/talk about if he would date them based on looks alone. Almost all were clearly underage and often they were dressed in very minimal clothing. If people called him out he would say, ‚Äúwell I never asked for them to be in their underwear! I didn‚Äôt ask their ages before making the video!‚Äù and he felt like that absolved him of any responsibility. He‚Äôs a scumbag and has been forever.

Then Onision crept into her life, groomed her, and destroyed it all .. now she has 2 kids but wants to be a man .. she claims her female body (which nourished and grew 2 healthy children) is something she hates and wants to be a dude. She's bullied into being a ""lesbian"" and bringing women into the house for his pleasure. 

Imagine what a great life she could have had if she hadn't been grooomed into a child bride for a pedo who will dump her and call her ""crazy"" the day she turns 24 (too old!) and he'll move on to his next 14yo child bride. ",t3_ad7y7x

My advice is to keep the lines of communication wide open between you and both of them. Keep an eye out for red flags and be there for her. There‚Äôs not much you could do to stop them from being together, anyway, and trying to break them up could just result in the loss of both friends.",t3_e92hlo

2183,entxnm3,t1_ennhpcf,"Tommy Robinson, real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, is a British far-right rabble rouser. He was initially involved in football hooliganism (which is part of the reason he uses the Tommy Robinson name, it's the name of a famous football hooligan and he was trying to seem more working class/'one of the lads') but became well-known for being leader of the English Defence League, a notoriously Islamophobic group who claimed merely to be 'fighting against radical Islam' but who seemed to target pretty much anything remotely connected to Islam, including making some really quite idiotic claims about 'creeping shari'ah' and how halal meat funds terrorism as well as the usual slew of anti-Islamic nonsense. EDL demonstrations were huge at one time and saw massive police presence, usually because the EDL were more than willing to get involved in physical altercations, including against anti-fascists but even against each other sometimes. It even reached a point where the EDL marched with other more extreme far-right groups including members of Pegida and known Combat 18 members. 

  Eventually Yaxley-Lennon left the EDL claiming he knew nothing about and didn't support these neo-Nazis, but it would seem this was a lie in itself bearing in mind that he was head of this organisation. He was also notoriously quiet when it came to the involvement of senior EDL members in paedophile cases, even after he and the EDL made a lot of noise screeching about 'Muslim rape gangs terrorising our girls'. In one case a 12 year old girl was so badly sexually abused by an EDL member she described every day it went on as being a living nightmare. 

  After some time spent with Quilliam, an anti-extremism group led by liberal Muslim Majid Nawaaz, and seemingly changing his stance on Islam for a while, he went right back to anti-Islamic rabble rousing, including taking hefty donations from donors abroad. 

In more recent times he's been infront of the courts (again) after he was arrested for disrupting a sex abuse trial involving Muslim defendants, accused of the sexual abuse of young disadvantaged girls in Rotherham and other towns. There was a media blackout on the case for the protection of the girls themselves and witnesses, but Robinson seemed determined to use the trial as proof that Muslim defendants somehow got treated more leniently by the courts, and chose to broadcast footage from the courts in defiance of the regulations which do not permit filming within court premises (and especially not of ongoing trials) in any case as well as the judge-ordered media restrictions. He was then subsequently arrested for contempt of court, and whilst an initial conviction was held to be unsafe a second one is due to take place with the likely result he'll serve more jail time (he's already been convicted of mortgage fraud and illegal entry into the US, as well as some other offences). Of course the whole thing was spun by many of his supporters as being about free speech and how he was being silenced for 'speaking out' and all this crap, which a LOT of ordinary people seem to be falling for.",t3_boz0ua

The Mirror‚Äôs 18-month investigation reveals abuse on unprecedented levels. They found:

* Social workers knew of abuse in the 1990s but police took a decade to launch a probe.
* Council staff viewed abused and trafficked children as ‚Äúprostitutes‚Äù instead of victims, according to previously unseen files.
* Authorities failed to keep details of abusers from Asian communities for fear of ‚Äúracism‚Äù.
* Police failed to investigate one recent case five times until an MP intervened.
* One victim said cops tried to stop her finding out why her abusers had not been prosecuted because they feared she would talk to us.
* One 14-year-old, groomed and abused after her phone number was sold to paedophiles, said: ‚ÄúI hated what was happening and my abusers made my skin crawl but I was told that if I said a word to anyone they‚Äôd come for my little sisters and tell my mum I was a prostitute.

>‚ÄúNight after night, I was forced to have sex with multiple men in disgusting takeaways and filthy houses. I must have been getting the morning after pill from a local clinic at least twice a week but no one asked any questions.

>‚ÄúI fell pregnant twice and had two abortions. Hours after my second termination, I was taken by one of my abusers to be raped by more men. The worst moment came just after my 16th birthday when I was drugged and gang raped by five men. Days later, the ringleader turned up at my house and told me he‚Äôd burn it down if I breathed a word of what had happened.‚Äù

Absolutely nothing is done to supervise or properly integrate these people, they are even so kind as to bring voting bills with Arabic instructions to their subsidised doorstep.

- UK politicians that make a career out of defrauding their population by manipulating statistics and enacting policies that hide minority crimes to sway public opinion and to bring in more minorities that conveniently also vote for said politicians. It's a self-reinforcing system that can only end in ever increasing chaos, which is one of the biggest weak points of representative democracy.

- UK's crony police state apparatus that gives high positions to politically inclined people, that in turn under orders of politicians force their officers to essentially engage in criminal acts by hiding or destroying evidence and settling cases outside of court with no persecution that involve minorities. The UK is notorious for allowing muslim ghettos to settle criminal cases between muslims in Sharia courts because then it doesn't enter their statistics. Not to mention those in power are so paranoid of their own people that low ranking officers aren't even armed with anything more than a baton and a pepper spray to the point where they are instructed to keep distance or run and call for armed backup if a suspect pulls out a knife ( not joking ).

- UK's public servants that make a job out of harassing the native population to stop them from reporting or exposing minority crime, threatening with fines or criminal records to perfectly civil people.

On top of that they all get funnelled into low income areas meaning the working class have to deal with all this shit and when we speak out we get called racist. Middle to upper class people know of one or two well integrated Asians who work and live amongst other white people and can speak English while the working class have to cope with families who refuse to learn basic English.

Personally I consider this possibility to be non existent, I believe that the Queen MUST have known about the people she was knighting being pedophiles, and given that she runs in the same circles as them, is it not logical to assume that they might have had the same interests?... if that makes me insane then I consider your ideal of sanity to be worthy of only disdain.

You need to understand that these old bloodlines, such as the royal family are inbred and probably insane, they know they are above the law too as our entire legal system would bend over to ensure they got off due to affluenzia or something equally absurd like their ""contributions to society""

> (23:7) ""As for those who seek beyond that, they are transgressors"". 
It literally says that the only thing lawful are wives and slaves, and anything beyond that is a transgression. Does this give Muslims free reign to rape anyone they want? No.  
  
> Quran (4:24) - ""And **all married women (are forbidden unto you) save those (captives)** whom your right hands possess.""  
Again, all women except your wife and slaves you own/captives of war are forbidden. Does this give Muslims free reign to rape anyone they want? No.  
  
> Quran (8:69) - ""But (now) enjoy what ye took in war, lawful and good""  
The spoils of war are to be enjoyed. Does this give Muslims free reign to rape anyone they want? No.  
  
> Quran (24:32) - ""And marry those among you who are single and those who are fit among your male slaves and your female slaves...""  
This passage makes it lawful to marry a slave you own. Does this give Muslims free reign to rape anyone they want? No.  
  
> Quran (2:178) - ""O ye who believe! Retaliation is prescribed for you in the matter of the murdered; the freeman for the freeman, and the slave for the slave, and the female for the female.""  
This passage deals with culpable homicide, and has nothing to do with rape.  
> 1) The principle of even retaliation is applied exclusively in cases of culpable homicide when someone has been killed intentionally with a lethal weapon causing injury and blood-loss.  
> 2) In a homicide of this nature, the killer is killed in even retaliation - 'free man for a free man, slave for a slave, and female for a female - and similarly, a man for a woman. The mention of 'free man for a free man' and 'female for a female' in this verse refers to a specific event in the background of which it was revealed.

Does this give Muslims free reign to rape anyone they want? No.  
  
> Quran (16:75) - ""Allah sets forth the Parable (of two men: one) a slave under the dominion of another; He has no power of any sort; and (the other) a man on whom We have bestowed goodly favours from Ourselves, and he spends thereof (freely), privately and publicly: are the two equal? (By no means;) praise be to Allah.'  
I don't see how this passage relates to any of the others, and you have misquoted the actual passage; ""by no means"" does not actually appear in the Quran. Here's a quick explanation of this passage.  
> For the polytheists a slave could never be equal to his master. This is set as an allegory to the fact that they worship idols which also are not equal to Allah, as they don't posses any provision for them as slave -on the other hand- don't have any possession. So the question addressed to them via this verse: was how can those Idols have any kind of likeness to Allah in his divinity?  
[You can read more on this passage here](http://www.islamicstudies.info/tafheem.php?sura=16&verse=75)  
Does this give Muslims free reign to rape anyone the want? No.  
  
So there you have it, I have gone through every passage you quoted and none of them seem to imply anything close to what you think they are implying. How do any of these passages allow for the raping of little girls exactly? Can they be interpreted as such? The answer to that question to anyone that actually takes the time to read and understand is no.  
  
And before you try and argue that ""slaves you own"" or ""captives of war"" can somehow refer to innocent little girls, I ask this: Were any of these girls owned by means of contract or legal ownership? No? Then they cannot be slaves according to the Islamic interpretation. Is there a religious war being waged anywhere in the world against Muslims simply because of their religion? Have the families of these little girls been waging war with Muslims? No? Then they cannot be captives of a war that doesn't exist.",t3_83j2bs

Another girl, Paige Chivers (who was the cousin of girl I went to school with) was assumed to have met the same fate at the hands of the towns very, very, very small immigrant population. She was even a cause c√©l√®bre for the likes of the BNP who staged a couple of rallies in Blackpool. Her body was never found. Turns out she was murdered by a convicted paedophile BNP supporter. Her father was himself murdered over 20 quid and was a heroic addict. Real sad case. So it can be easy to assume that Pakistani's/Bangladeshi's are the perpetrators of these crimes, but it's not always the case. 

Back to Charlene Downes - the case collapsed under mysterious circumstances. There's apparently a surveillance tape recording of the guys breaking down and crying and admitting what they did (i.e. kebabs), but there was some sort of fuck up by the police which meant the evidence (if there was any to begin with?) was inadmissible in court. Ultimately one of the coppers was found guilty of misconduct and was fired. She subsequently took the Police to court and was awarded a payout. I think Reveshi was jailed for a little while and also took the government to court and was awarded a payout. So the whole thing was a complete dogs breakfast and stunk to high heaven, and the town's populace are understandably very pissed off whenever Charlene is mentioned. I very much doubt we'll ever really know what happened, but the general feeling by most in the town is that Reveshi and Albattikhi did it and have gotten away with it - with a couple of hundred grand from the tax payer, to boot.",t3_83ikpd

>>The scale of the abuse uncovered in Telford ‚Äì population 170,000 ‚Äì is feared to be the most brutal and long-running of all.
>>
>>The Rotherham toll was put at 1,500 ‚Äì but that was in a community of 260,000.

2750,dviwrk9,t1_dvi5lsm,">The concept of a reactionary left originated when cultural and moral relativism left the postmodernist lens of academia and entered popular political discourse.[6] The concept most people define as ""multiculturalism"" today is the secular idea of cultural pluralism combined with this new, politically active relativism. Since relativism is a neutral academic stance, applying it to current political or ideological causes raises problems. A relativist observer holds that there is no objective standard by which one culture or moral system can be measured to be better than another. This position (if held absolutely) logically entails that liberal values such as free speech and equal rights are not objectively better than a rejection of them.[7]

>So what happens when a conflict involves a disadvantaged group that not only does not support, but actively opposes progressive values such as tolerance of sexual identity or gender equality? For the ""relativist progressive"", there are three possible courses ‚Äî they can abandon relativism and advocate for change in all groups, even if it means placing pressure on already disadvantaged groups; they can reserve their criticisms for the dominant group alone by employing a tactical form of relativism which only applies to marginalized groups, in extreme cases even shielding the disadvantaged group from criticism as it continues to oppress others; or they can simply insist no value can be known to be better than another and wing it according to whatever trendy movement is popular with them at the moment. The latter two options are by some described as ""the regressive left."" Some liberals, such as Natalie Reed, argue postmodernists can avoid the pitfalls of relativism, and take firm positions on issues across social and cultural boundaries.[8]

>Those on the regressive left think that the concept of cultural pluralism raises difficult questions about how progressive liberals should act in a pluralistic society. How should a feminist criticize patriarchy, while also being mindful that some disadvantaged groups have a patriarchal culture? How should an atheist take a strong position against religion, while also recognizing that minority religious groups are marginalized in society? For anyone with half a brain, of course, the answer is simple: Having your beliefs and values criticized in no way amounts to being oppressed.

Dealing with this sort of community issue, where the difficulty of policing inside of a community is apparent due to said community's tendency to be closed, isn't solved by making the native white populace think that Muslim communities all harbour child sex rings!

In fact, the Jay Report found that the biggest burdens to investigating child sexual exploitation were disbelief of child victims and misunderstanding of the crime and its risk factors.  You can see that these are the principal problems for investigation in the guidelines that various agencies created after the publication of the Jay Report.

For example, the [College of Policing guidelines](https://www.app.college.police.uk/app-content/major-investigation-and-public-protection/child-sexual-exploitation/#investigating-cse-cases) lists police officers' suspicions about the anti-social behaviour and delayed reporting of victims as the pre-eminent barriers to child sexual exploitation investigations.  Moreover, [CPS guidelines](https://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/child-sexual-abuse-guidelines-prosecuting-cases-child-sexual-abuse) (35-60) sought principally to outline risk factors and reform how children's statements are understood, rather than anything to do with ethnicity.",t3_83ikpd

The larger divide between current immigrants and us is due to our own advancements in society, not because they are more backward than many earlier immigrants.

Now that same immigrant needs to learn to treat women as equals, to not beat children, and to at the very least tolerate LGBT people.

Current immigrants and their children will have to go through a painful process of cultural and societal reckoning, but it's necessary to spare future generations from self-hatred and abuse.

I guess, not break the law or abuse children would be a good start, but if it's under the definition of assimilating, then, non-immigrants break the law and abuse children too. 

Like I said, I get what you mean, I just struggle to articulate what you might actually set down on paper that immigrants would have to do, for us to think of them as assimilated. I don't know. The whole issue is really tough.

We don't allow unfettered low income migration from Pakistan anymore.

The immigration changes you're asking for won't change the situation because they've already happened in the last 15 years. Current immigration policy is not the problem or solution to this issue because we simply don't really let people like this in anymore from Pakistan.

I don't that that's an unreasonable statement for a defence attorney to make.  The kids in the rape cases *did* initially go into it ""willingly"", but they were coerced by men much older than them. That was grooming, in the same way this girl was groomed. Its obviously wrong to ascribe any blame to the rape victims, but if we accept that young girls can be coerced into doing bad things by older men, then why can't that be the case elsewhere? 

Now I'm not defending her, I'm saying that doesn't sound like an unreasonable defence. Throwing her in jail for  *a minimum of* 11 years rather than 13, for a crime she planned  when she was 15 doesn't seem like that big a problem.

In many cases it was. In others it was statutory rape. I have a problem with these sorts of simplifications because they lead to complete misunderstandings of what happened.

If they had actually just roamed around grabbing and raping kids then it would be a far more severe issue that it was 'ignored' by the authorities, but that's not what happened. CSE is a far cry from simple rape. it's multiple times more complicated and more nuanced.

There is plenty of criminal activity evidence and suspicious code language (hence pizzagate). 

Are there looneys running around screaming pizzagate? Yes. Is there wild speculation and falsehoods out there? Absolutely. 

But there's also creepy emails about playing domino's on pizza instead of pasta, dreaming about hot dog stands in Hawaii, pizza related maps on handkerchiefs, and kids in the pool for entertainment. 

Not to mention a shady cast of characters. How many convicted child molesters do you know? Cause the Clintons know an awful lot. And these convictions were not enough to break association. 

I don't believe that every democratic candidate is a pedo or that Hilary runs a ring (thanks Snopes ha). But I do think that predators are attracted to positions of power (political, Hollywood, religious power) so inevitably some people in these positions are predators. 

And they have enough money to pay for politicians to look the other way or worse. And the Democratic party seems to be dependent on this money to the point where the ends always justify the means. 

Plenty of goofs in the republican side but they aren't as downright sinister as the democrats. Heck look at the caucus system vs the republican primary. Or the way the DNC can be bought off by Hilary too cut out Bernie, and the super delegates.

I do agree that the left is pro-pedophilia. Or it's moving in that direction. If you want to have a short glimpse into the future for where the left wing is headed just look at England. Where in Rotherham the labour party straight covered up pedophiles grooming and having sex with kids. Over like a ten year period!

3345,e5ud8bw,t3_9exbsk,"I will give you the benefit of the doubt that you're a real person. I had this crazy ""redpill"" moment recently and really did 180 on my belief system. Or rather, my beliefs stayed pretty much the same, but I realized that the left was NOT the party of morality, truth, science, etc. I was also accused of being a bot, shill, you name it.

What started my questioning of the left is transgender ideology. I was linked to the gendercritical sub as a ""hate sub"" but realized what they're saying there makes a lot of sense. In a nutshell, the trans narrative reinforces gender stereotypes and is damaging to women and children. Men too, but that isn't the angle I approached it from. That sub is highly critical of the sex positive movement, porn, and prostitution. (Not critical of the women in these positions, but the system that victimizes them. Huge difference.) The left pushes stuff like anal sex on teens. This is gross, pornsick stuff. Look up the article on anal sex in Teen Vogue. Female children are absolutely being groomed into thinking anal sex is a normal, safe, enjoyable thing that all the cool girls do. 

There are also a ton of liberal parents who are teaching their children that ""bodies"" have penises or vaginas, but do not associate these parts with men or women. Because to do so would offend the tiny portion of the populace that ""identifies"" as one gender but has the genitals of the other. 

I'm a parent of young children and was a die-hard liberal until I started looking more closely at all this stuff pushed on children. I'm not in agreement that it's grooming them for pedophiles but it is absolutely damaging to individuals and society as a whole. I don't want my daughter to go to preschool and be told she can be a boy if she wants. I'm teaching her that girls can do anything. Her being smart, athletic, and strong does not make her a boy. Likewisr my son's can be empathetic or play with dolls or god forbid like pink and it doesn't make them girls. I don't want my perfect boys to decide to mess up their bodies with hormones and cut their penises off in the name of this gender bullshit.

So I also walked away. When the wool is pulled from your eyes it's hard not to see hypocrisy and lies everywhere in the MSM and in social media. I'm somewhat lost at the moment but slowly finding my way. Undoing a life of brainwashing is hard.",t3_9exbsk

I highly recommend you check them out for their bravery against a sea of ignorance. It's not about hating gays. It's about keeping it where it belongs: in the bedroom between consenting adults. Not spilling into the streets and forced upon everyone around.    
    
A few other wonderful people to follow for the red pill ideals they bring are [Blonde in the Belly of the Beast](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpbyOgUSjTSPpvVUAT2OyHw), [Lauren Southern](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCla6APLHX6W3FeNLc8PYuvg), and [Steven Crowder](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIveFvW-ARp_B_RckhweNJw). They each offer a different flavor and direction. And while some things are going to be more direct and harsh (Blonde is very vocal about her disgust of feminism and how many women discard their femininity for instance), others can be very entertaining and endearing (Steven Crowder, popular for his ""Change My Mind"" topics, has a lot of fantastic videos). But like any other source, do your research and take what they say with some grain of salt. I absolutely love Lauren Southern, but she does a lot of work with Stefan Molyneux, and his end of the world views don't sit well with me. Which would be fine, but she echos a lot of his work.

3386,e5snket,t1_e5sg5l3,"I went through your Salon Article this is what I found:

"" War on sex ed heats up: Right-wing activists in California weaponize fake news

## A supposed ‚Äúgrassroots‚Äù rebellion against sex ed in California is fueled by a right-wing propaganda campaign""

Those are their claims.

It starts with "" After George W. Bush left the White House, many people believed that his  failed sex education policies ‚Äî which forced states to teach kids  abstinence until marriage and rejected contraception education ‚Äî were  over and done with. The¬†sad reality is that in the decade since then,  undoing the damage has been a slow and incomplete process. ""

That is a strawman. They're attempting to compare the parents who are upset to an abstinence campaign . That isn't went they want, they want a choice in sexual education and when as parents.

"" Conservatives have¬†turned to the same tactics¬†to undermine California's  law that right-wing forces and Russian propagandists used to distort the  2016 election: Disseminating fake news and lies through social media. ""

Buzz word to compare Christians, Muslims, Jewish, and other religious people (because the coalition is multiple belief systems to Russians in order to disqualify their views. It has nothing to do with Russia or Russians. An attempt to manipulate the reader by comparing two unlike things.

On one of the articles listed:

"" The [California Healthy Youth Act](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160AB329)  went into effect in 2016 and requires that middle and high schools  teach unbiased and medically accurate sex education, including lessons  on birth control and abortion. But there is concern about how much  support the curriculum is getting in the politically conservative  central San Joaquin Valley, which has [a history of pushback](http://www.fresnobee.com/news/local/education/article19664793.html) against such lessons.

Read more here: r/[https://www.fresnobee.com/news/special-reports/too-young/article165478887.html#storylink=cpy](https://www.fresnobee.com/news/special-reports/too-young/article165478887.html#storylink=cpy)""

Some business owners don't want to sell condoms to young people. That is up to the store and their policy. It seems Salon, and some various groups concerned with sex ed, not only want to take away a parent's right to raise their child (going against multiple religious and cultural groups) They want to expand enforcement to the private sector.

**"" Using titillating but false accusations,** [**such as the claim that kids are being taught how to have anal sex in school**](http://www.newsweek.com/lgbt-sexual-health-education-activist-mommy-elizabeth-johnston-planned-876997)**,  conservatives are sowing panic in local communities, spreading fear  that a curriculum meant to keep kids safe is hurting them instead. ""**

Salon never disproved that kids were not being informed about anal sex, the proof they list is some mother complaining about it. They proved that some parents don't want it talked about.

One of the sources Salon gives, which is a broad racial makeup of those protesting and gives examples is [here](https://www.churchmilitant.com/news/article/san-diego-parents-fight-pornographic-sex-ed-curriculum).

**"" In¬†reality, the lessons for high school  students simply acknowledge that things like oral and anal sex¬†exist,  something teenagers are already talking about and many experiment with.**

**Here's a screenshot from a handout for ninth-graders, which shows how the mentions of oral and anal sex are framed:""**

Salon admits that what parent's are complaining about does exist, in fact that is seen multiple times in the resources and the article itself. The argument salon has against it is ""So what"".

It's an opinion piece that did prove any of it's claims, in fact the evidence provided actually disproves their claim. It is no surprise that this opinion piece is written by "" Amanda Marcotte is a politics writer for Salon. Her new book, ""[Troll Nation: How The Right Became Trump-Worshipping Monsters Set On Rat-F\*cking Liberals, America, and Truth Itself](https://www.amazon.com/Troll-Nation-Trump-Worshipping-Monsters-Liberals/dp/1510737456/?tag=saloncom08-20),"" is out now. She's on Twitter @AmandaMarcotte ""

You think a book like that from Amanada Marcotte is going to be unbiased? No. It is just more evidence, along with this article, to show her narrowed minded and blind when it comes to other's beliefs and cultures.

Let's go over her original claims:

**"" War on sex ed heats up: Right-wing activists in California weaponize fake news:**

Never proven, and a sensationalist title. While there are some christian groups behind it, there are other groups against it as well. The thing they have in common seems to be they are all parents who do not like the sexual ed program for their child.

**A supposed ‚Äúgrassroots‚Äù rebellion against sex ed in California is fueled by a right-wing propaganda campaign""**

The articles listed and evidence given show that this isn't the case. The article actually disproved this. It is also not a ""war on sex education"", but parents who don't like what is being taught and when.

Throughout the piece, and we can go over more examples, the writer showed all the claims they said in at least some ways were fulfilled. Now in some cases it was exaggerated. However, throughout the article it is obvious that the writer is tone deaf to the cultural beliefs of many in California who do not want this for their child. That is what is happening. Should parents have a say in what their child is taught regarding sex education, or should the government's power supersede that of a parent, and in some cases, private businesses?

She doesn't understand this, and she won't. I don't believe it's some vast conspiracy, and in fact in most articles the parents didn't think the same. Most were not against any form of sex education, they wanted a say in what was taught and when. I think that is a reasonable request.",t3_9exbsk

You don't have to believe in its message to understand that it has spoken of this thousands of years (And 600 years after Christianity) before this supposed ""Final Religion"" crawled out of a cave.

No membership to Christianity required.  You live in a nation that's created by those who believe in the Judeo-Christian assumption that the person is divine and has God-given rights.  This does not exist outside Western culture.

They're calling an unborn child a non-person now.  They're claiming that it's just a part of a female body similar to an organ.  When you see the signs and read between the lines, you see that it is rightfully described as evil.

This is the political alignment that everyone should understand.  Class struggle puts the mob over the individual.  The smallest minority possible.  They take your right to preserve your own life.

I hope you can see the distinction here between _approved_ and _required_. It seems one requirement for this approval is that the material is _factual_ and based on current research. Which is kind of important, since this is **health information**. It's bad enough that parents can opt out of this material for their kids; don't expect the state to lie to them as well.

Here's your linked author on the importance of protecting kids from this information:

> Most parents would agree that children should be taught to steer away from risky sexual behavior and encourage them to abstain from sexual activity all together until their married, not encourage them to explore sexual acts and identities.

I wouldn't weigh his words too hard. He's just another celebrity, you got tons of them, probably a lot with more brains, maybe some with less. Stick to the definition of things, to facts, things you can rely on, where you don't have to question anything. The definition of words doesn't change easily, mostly just what we perceive of a word. Decide what you think is right, not what people tell you is right (I get the irony of me telling you what I perceive as right, but just like that, you're free to ignore me at any time)

As said, retards exist on both sides and there might be a good chance Jim Carrey isn't an exception in this

Politics isn't left and right. That's one of the most important things you have to understand. There is politics which simply acts on what is required and decides on what is needed. It's centrist politics. Liberalism relates more to exactly this. The definition of equality. Why would the opinion of a rightists, of a republican or heck, even a n actual nazi, be worth less than an opinion of a leftist, an anarchist, a religious fanatist, yours, mine? We all have one and they all are formed by our own life experiences, which are individual for every one of us. And we should always, in all cases, take the time to listen to them, validate them, discuss them and then collectively decide if it's the right thing to do or not.

Being a democrat doesn't mean you want to rape children or demand straight up socialism or communism. Being a rightist doesn't mean you're a nazi white supremacist warmonger. But you can be sure in both groups you'll find those. In small numbers, luckily. And making a news article out of their demands doesn't make them a movement within the whole group.

And most importantly, liberals don't do identity politics. By definition. And if they do, they are not liberals and they got the definition wrong most probably just as many people seem to do these days. Most of us are liberal. I mean, the liberalism I am talking of, the one you find the definition of on wikipedia and similar sites, is exactly the same that makes up the american values of freedom and equality. The values the US and the EU, commonly known as the 1st world, share, that make up our prosperity.

Wood refuse to apologise, withdraw the allegation and left the tweet up until he was contacted by the police, long after he'd become aware of its existence. This suggests that he was very much complicit.

The judge cited the following reasons behind his judgement:

* Wood set up the twitter account, it was registered to his email address and as such he could change the password and lock other users out at any time.

* One of the campaigning platforms was to seek to highlight that the Labour Party controlled Rotherham Council when the child sexual exploitation scandal had taken place. So this theme of attack was in keeping with Wood's strategy.

* Mr Wood had given Mr Langley and others a standing instruction that no-one was to make racist or xenophobic attack and had put in place a rule that he should have prior approval of all tweets. He never enforced this rule and Langley had posted racist material on behalf of Bristol Ukip at least twice before and Wood was aware of Langley publishing material on a website that he regarded as racist. Despite this Wood neither removed Langley from this position nor enforced his prior approval rule.

* The tweet was published by Mr Langley, not on his own account, but in discharge of his role as campaign manager and in the course of, and for the purpose of, executing the task delegated to him by Mr Wood

* Mr Wood could not escape liability because Mr Langley acted against the general prohibition on publishing material which was an attack on others ‚Äì he was acting within the scope of the job delegated to him by Mr Wood.

It might have been different if Monir had decided to sue Langley instead but he didn't. The precedent exists that when responsibility for running communications like this is delegated by the principal to an agent, the principal is responsible for the actions of that agent.

In this instance we have people defending Tommy Robinson's right to record and publish images of defendants before the legal process is complete (my understanding before your post was that there are media restrictions in place surrounding these trials not just affecting TR).

Attempting to explain things in an honest way to rabble rousers of this kind doesn't win over their crowd. It's part of a wider tactic of shutting out debate known as ""never playing defence"". 

Rather than engaging in an actual reasonable debate you simply keep asking short accusatory questions that painfully oversimplify complex issues. Any attempt to honestly engage these questions and explain things fails because it looks like you're on the back foot. Increasingly, political figures are recognising what media has understood for years; people respond more strongly to feelings than facts.

We live in a world where the facts aren't nearly as authoritative as they used to be. Large numbers of angry people on the right and left don't defer to rational debate anymore, in fact, it's seen as something to be disregarded.

This isn't a theory. The prison administrators literally arranged that to happen before, and the only reason he's alive is because a guard tipped him off and told him to not, under any circumstances, agree to have his cell moved. He refused and as a result he was put in a solitary cell instead of next to hardcore Muslim murderers, who he later found were planning to kill him. 

His arrest was so expedient because he was on parole. But it won't be 13 months in jail, it'll be the rest of his life. The prison overseers already previously arranged things to try and get him murdered by Muslims twice. The first time he had just arrived and a fellow (white) prisoner tipped him off that Muslims were boiling water and sugar to attack him with it--a substance that'll stick to your face and burn your flesh off, most likely resulting in death, if not permanent debilitating disfigurement. In response Robinson preemptively went up to them and started a fight, resulting in him being placed in solitary confinement--thus saving his life.
The second time it was the intervention of a single (white? I forget) guard who previously saved him. The guard arrived seconds before other guards and told him to refuse to move cells under any circumstances, as he was about to be moved to the wing of the prison where Muslim gang-members serving life sentences were placed. He later learned it was the deliberate decision of the (female) prison administrator to place him there, and she had also previously refused to listen to his petitions to keep him separated from the hardcore Muslim criminals, given the previous attempts on his life.
The circumstances under which he was previously arrested were obvious bullshit too, like purposefully placing him under protective custody so that he'd miss a court appointment and be thrown back into prison because of it. Not to mention they investigated his entire family until they found a clerical error in his brother's business, then sued and seized all his assets, as well as his brother's. After protracted legal struggles to avoid his family from being destroyed, UK spooks approached him multiple times and said they could make it all go away if he agreed to be controlled opposition for the British equivalent of the white-rights movement.
In other words, the UK government is conspiring to murder Tommy Robinson. I recommend listening to this interview: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkqdusRWA_g

What does this phrase mean ""in cases that the police have not yet reached?""  It is unclear what you are trying to say exactly?

Yes, he feels it is an ongoing issue.

How exactly did he interfere with the workings of justice in this case?

That maybe Tommy Robinson is a reaction to a very big problem. Context is everything. 

There was a systematic cover up by certain governmental parties over a very long period covering decades, plural.

The authorities tried to cover the fact that is was predominantly *Muslim Pakistani* grooming gangs preying on *white girls deemed chavs*, and that everyone who had a duty and was actually supposed to protect and help them disregarded that for *the greater good*.

That *greater good* being to prevent a repeat of previous riots and mayhem when the race relations hit rock bottom in the late 80s and early 90s.

What's a few thousand chavs when it comes to community cohesion and protecting cushy jobs.

So considering the above, perhaps Tommy was there to ensure that the Powers that attempted to sweep it under the rug last time, don't get another chance to do so at the courts via a media blackout.

I know that the de jure answer in the UK is the courts trump the press but in somewhere like the US the ""1st v 5th"" debate isn't so clear cut but generally leans more towards the press.

For me personally I can't find an answer I'm comfortable with. The moment you say ""courts>press"" it immediately raises concerns about what the courts might be preventing the public from knowing. This can be mitigated by allowing the press to observe all relevant aspects of court proceedings but insist they delay the actual reporting until after proceedings are concluded, but this still leaves an air of suspicion hanging.

However, there is something here that just stinks of a political motive.

Robinson's offensive was far from serious. That level of ""harrasment"" was so minor I could hardly imagine it warrants a fine it certainly doesn't warrant prison time at all, let alone 13 months!

‚ÄúUNICEF said, however, that girls continued to be more likely to wed young, with one in five women aged 20 to 24 having been married before the age of 18 compared with one in 30 men. Together, the number of married boys and girls stands at around 765 million, the study showed.
The United Nations has made it a goal for child marriages to be banned in all countries by 2030.‚Äù

So, after reading the title of the post in this sub...

...we shouldn't be on the topic and discuss the girls?

There's cases of female abusers everyday treated differently because society and media treat male victims as not so ""victimized"". And now, even in the same breath male victimization is minimized with statistics so you yourself are back to them not being as important? Wasn't it you that criticized so flippantly that somehow I inferred females have it ""better""? Yet here we are with the pot shouting how black the kettle is. 

You've been indoctrinated into the belief that females must be victims and males aren't so much.

I'll leave you with this; look how easily the Catholic church's abuse of boys has been swept away and rarely makes the news anymore despite doing little at all to address it. Yet, a politician will surely make a comment to a grown woman in the coming weeks that she perceives as sexual and he'll lose a presidential campaign over it. It isn't popular, but more and more men are being marginalized. Just stand back and look. No one has it better, but marginalizing one gender over another is exactly what you're arguing against, and yet you've just done it by changing the topic of the entire post.",t3_bxsqfy

1, Tommy was on parole he fucked up and went to jail for violating it, this has nothing to do with his political views. This is possible if and even likely if you look at this event in a vacuum with no history to it.

2, The British government want to silence Tommy and anyone who is bringing light to the mass child rape and torture by Pakistani gangs in England. If you follow the events from the original cover-ups this looks a lot more likely.

Harmless doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs legal or moral. He was on a suspended sentence from previous legal problems, he choose to continue pushing the envelope. 

It bit him in the ass and he now gets 13 month of free room and board at a British penal institution.

His means might justify this end, if their really is something so horribly unjust going on in the UK than a 13 month jail term is worth standing up for what he sees as the right thing. Especially if it calls attention to this issue in the UK and gets people discussing this issue and demanding change in the UK. 

All power to him, civil disobedience is a virtue in most cases. My only problem is this lopsided reporting that makes him out to be some saint being persecuted when in reality he is willfully and intentionally stirring the pot. That might be the right thing to do here, but it comes with consequences sometimes.

‚ÄúHis means might justify this end, if their really is something so horribly unjust going on in the UK that a 13 month jail term is worth standing up for what he sees as the right thing. Especially if it calls attention to this issue in the UK and gets people discussing this issue and demanding change in the UK. ‚Äú

> He has done nothing to deserve an hour behind bars, let alone 13 months

That I cannot make a knowledge statement on since I‚Äôm completely ignorant on UK contempt of court laws. Specifically what constitutes contempt of court of someone on a suspended sentence and what appropriate sentencing for this offense in this situation should be in the United Kingdom. 

That said in general pushing for a change in government or fighting an injustice rarely means the punishments meted out to those fighting for change are because they were deserved. They almost always are undeserved but you can‚Äôt practice civil disobedience without getting undeserved punishment. In fact the ENTIRE point of civil disobedience is to get undeserved punishment to point out the hypocrisy of the law or regulation you find offensive in the first place.  

> And please remember that I believe that you cannot run for election if you have been placed in her majesty's pleasure for more than 12. 

Which if it is or is not correct (pardon me if I distrust your powers of recollection when you can‚Äôt remember what I did or did not seconds after reading it) still has no relevance to what is being discussed. His ability to run for elected office in the future has absolutely nothing to do with his previous or current decision to engage in civil disobedience. 

> So this was deliberate and planned. Something no conservative should ever believe should happen.

So today I learned rule of law apparently doesn‚Äôt matter if an single Australian objects to said law. 

Laws even unjust or immoral laws need to be obeyed until they are changed by the proper lawful processes (legislative or judicial) or until the government that has continued to abuse and mistreat their population so badly with tyrannical laws is removed from power by the ballot box or the rifle. 

Simply refusing to acknowledge laws one disagrees with is NOT a conservative value, NOR should it ever be a conservative value. Civil disobedience is one thing it‚Äôs a form of more radical protest and as long as the protestor accepts the lawful consequences of said disobedience it‚Äôs a powerful tool to peacefully protest injustice and right wrongs in government and the law by drawing public attention to a problem. 

To be honest you sound like a libertarian or progressive  to me personally not a conservative.

They talk a lot about charitable giving and do some very public giving. There are some smaller scale operations too, like the Bishops Storehouse (where poorer Mormons can get cheap or free food).

But really when you look at their income vs their charitable giving, it does real charities an injustice to put Mormons in with them. For example: [This Salt Lake Tribune article from 2012](http://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=54478720&itype=CMSID) estimates the Church's annual income to be up to $8 Billion.

The Church released a wellfare services 'fact sheet' (also in the above article) which according to the Church they spent $1.3 Billion 
in ""more than"" 178 countries and territories over a span of 25 years from 1985 to 2010.

In 2012, the LDS Church spent $2 Billion on the City Creek Center, a shopping mall in downtown Salt Lake City. They spent more on that mall, than they spent on 'welfare' (ie Charity) over 25 years.

You have [here](https://www.deseretnews.com/article/865657898/LDS-Church-welfare-humanitarian-efforts-average-40-million-per-year-apostle-says.html), one of the apostles (pretty top dog in the hierarchy) saying in the Deseret News (a rather Pro-Mormon newspaper) that the LDS Church spends $40 Million a year on Humanitarian efforts. Using that $8 Billion income estimate from above that's what, 0.5% of their yearly income?

So I will disagree on ""they also do a lot of charitable giving"". They do a lot of ""big public charitable giving"" and try to make it seem like there is a lot more than there is.

They also provide many other welfare services for their members. I would be interested to know where the rest of their money goes before drawing a final conclusion, as well as the same kind of breakdown of other religions controlling for size and net worth. 

Supposedly the mall was not built with tithing money, but from other investments.

Since no one in the church is paid with the exception of the leadership who get a $120k / year living stipend (not paid for out of tithing: http://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=4800350&itype=CMSID), it's not like any individual is getting rich off the money that the church brings in like we see in some christian churches.

Polygamy is a marriage which includes more than two partners. There are numerous examples of polygamy among close followers, devotees, and the faithful to God in the Old Testament, but it is generally not accepted by contemporary Christians. Some Christians actively debate whether the New Testament or Christian ethics allows or forbids polygamy and there are several Christian views on the Old Covenant. This debate focuses almost exclusively on polygyny (one man having more than one wife) and not polyandry (one woman having more than one husband).

>Why am I so annoyed when the article says about 11 year old kids being raped and abused and they go to show photos with fishnets to pull on clicks. Disgusting shit. 

>Did people just forget that britain ""lost"" thousands of reports of child sexual abuse by their government officials just a year or so ago?

>Jesus Christ, [it's like every town in Britain](https://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/83koyt/britains_worst_ever_child_grooming_scandal/dvipgg3/) has multiple child rape gangs that have been going on for decades and no one seems to care.

>What the fuck. How have people not dealt with this. It honestly makes me sick to know stuff like this goes on relatively brazenly with no justice for the victims.

>Police collected all of her clothes, several bags of it, since it was the only evidence of the years of repeated rapes. Then lost the clothes. All of them. Every single bag, and told them not to press charges because now it had become a she said he said thing.

>""The dads had attempted to remove their daughters from houses where abuse was taking place, but they were the ones who were then arrested by police."" How the actual fuck is this possible?

>They were drunk, low-class, and not a protected group. They made for an easier arrest than the rapists. You have to keep in mind a lot of these girls were ""willing"" (rather, groomed and abused into thinking they were willing). These 12, 13, 14-year-old girls would habitually run away to their abusers for drugs and money and a sick sense of belonging. So the police came up with the idea that, instead of treating them as victims, they would treat them as ""slags"" and ""whores."" In that mindset, when the police come up on a house, they don't see a father trying to save his daughter from child rape, they see a trespassing, belligerent drunk interfering in a slag's business. It's a systemic sickness in the police culture of those towns.

>The way the UK is headed and police attitudes, it might even get worse because they will be afraid to admit it is happening.

>This is a perfect example of trash under the rug mentality. A lot of innocent have to suffer in order for some fat ass to do something. If a rich person goes through this, it's solved urgently.

>""Council staff viewed abused and trafficked children as ‚Äúprostitutes‚Äù instead of victims, according to previously unseen files."" Okay what in the actual fuck is this shit. Kids are getting gang rapped, AND ARE BEING viewed as prostitutes. 11 years OLD. What the absolute fuck.

During my childhood we had a family friend who would visit often, also no kids of his own and single. He would always slip me $5 or $10 whenever he was visiting; I thought he was the coolest dude. 

As I got a bit older, maybe 10 or 11, he started buying me more lavish gifts. I think at first my mom was ok with it as her and my dad had recently separated and she was probably feeling guilty for not being able to buy me frivolous things.  So I would get a new pair of Nike shoes, new Nike coat, my first pieces of make-up.  Soon after it was a CD player stereo, then Nike rollerblades, then an electric guitar.  Anything I asked for, I got. 

He would tell my mom his building has a pool in it and I should come for swims sometimes.  This is where things got...weird. I won't go into detail. But I was only 12 years old, and even though things felt wrong, it was hard to articulate, and even harder considering this man had only ever been so kind and giving to me. 

I can't exactly remember how the last bit went down, or how my mom  wised up, but the man told me he would stop in at our house one morning before I go to school to check up on me (something about making sure the nail polish he bought me wasn't flaking off my nails - you know, coz it's not a good look). I agreed to this.  That morning, he shows up just like he said he would and I let him in.  Before I knew it, my mom (who normally went to work hours before me) was storming up the basement stairs yelling at him to get the hell out of our house. 

I never saw him again. 

I still haven't told my mom everything he did, and how grateful I am to her for not letting it escalate. ",t3_7x08kq

Now why would a 60 yr old man want a 5 yr old to stay the night?

I remember when he asked mom and she didn't even flinch, ""sure"".

I was 9 or 10 and knew something was wrong with this so I begged my mom not to let her. When she acted like it wasn't a big deal I then refused to let her go alone.

He was so pissed...he didn't like me and now I know why. Nothing ever happened when we stayed the night but it makes me sick to my stomach on what could of happened if I didn't go with her.

My friend is in his late 50s and has no children but loves kids and has young nieces. Since my daughter was about a year old he's referred to her as ""my friend"", talked about her so much it's as if he's obsessed with her, stared at her, grinning, for ages when he's been supposed to be watching a sports event, picked her up and cuddled her repeatedly without permission, brushed dirt off her backside without asking, or even telling her why he was touching her, photographed her without permission and lots of other things I'm not comfortable with (like the time I overhear him waxing lyrical to some bemused mutual friends about my daughter's ""Mona Lisa smile"" when she wasn't even there).

After the first warning when I told him in no uncertain terms he had to gain consent before touching her (MY consent as well as hers: she's still only 2) and he carried on doing weird stuff, he's now banned from interacting with her at all beyond saying hello and goodbye. 

It was hard especially as I'm actually pretty sure he'd never do anything awful to her. The problem was he didn't understand he was grooming her to accept this sort of behaviour without question from adults whereas I'm trying to teach her about bodily autonomy and consent and he was undermining me.",t3_7x08kq

My comment was also geared towards non-immediate family members, totally not relevant at all to parents. 

At the end of the day, it‚Äôs all a big huge grey area that only parents can look at and decide where the lines should be drawn. It‚Äôs almost impossible to draw the line exactly where it needs to be, but it‚Äôs better to be (slightly) on the side of too cautious than (even slightly) too lax. Which sucks.

A friend of my parents‚Äô groomed me when I was a kid, and now that I look back on it as an adult the creep definitely used my dad‚Äôs hearing loss as an advantage as one of his tactics (saying things ‚Äúin front‚Äù of my dad to me, knowing my dad wouldn‚Äôt be able to hear or read his lips if the creep‚Äôs back was to my dad), but making it appear normal because who would say something so bad *in front of your parent* if it wasnt ok? My mom was more aware of that sort of thing (creep never did it when she was close by), it might have to do with just the different experiences girls have growing up that OP‚Äôs Mom was aware and nothing of the sort ever crossed the dad‚Äôs mind in OP‚Äôs story. 

I will never tell my dad now because it would just break his heart; but I wish he knew back then and realized that even someone who is a friend can groom or hurt a kid. I know he loves me and would do anything to protect me, there‚Äôs no point in hurting him by bringing it up now so many years later. ",t3_7x08kq

She doesn‚Äôt owe him anything, and a large part of grooming is letting things like that slide because you somehow feel indebted to that person.

For many people, that isn't zero proof. The caution her mother showed combined with actions that OP remembers being uncomfortable with could be damning. It is all a matter of perspective.

That can be [a problem](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7vj8av/oh_i_22_was_confronted_about_an_alleged_sexual/). From one perspective, it can look like child abuse. From another, it can simply be a teenager growing up. The process of sorting that out can end careers, ruin lives, and worse. It leads to things like this:

> Thank you for this. I will probably not be continuing with the mentorship program after all this - perhaps volunteering at the nursing home is a safer choice.

It leads to less coaches, mentors, tutors, teachers, social workers, and more when we need them more than ever. It has gotten so bad that one swim coach commented there aren't enough new people entering the program to replace the people retiring now. In a few years, the only people with access to coaches will be those that can pay the fees and that is a tragedy. Low income and minority areas deserve to have a great programs in their communities as well. 

It gets even worse. 

In the future, the person quoted saying the nursing home is a safer choice might see a child wandering down the street. What would they do after being accused before and having that on their record?

Would they call 911 to be recorded as the last person to see the child alive?

Would they stop and invite an unattended child into their car to give them a ride home? 

or would they simply keep driving hoping for the best while not getting involved?

If we make law abiding people, the type who volunteer to mentor kids, afraid to stop, who will end up stopping to collect the child? 

These questions worry me. I hope people will step up. We need them to.",t3_7x08kq

I don't intend this as criticism, and it sounds like you're protecting your child, but this seems *really* strange and you seem to be going to great lengths to normalize it.

4549,du6s97u,t1_du6pkq7,"Hi - it's worth it.  I came across her work when I was reading a bunch of books about psychopathy (e.g. The Psychopath Test by Jon Ronson) out of interest, and I found out she writes quite a bit on pedophiles too. 

At the time I was a father of two toddler boys and I was horrified by what I read (this type of abuse didn't happen to me, and my friends and family never really talked how to protect your kids from predators).  I read about stories of predators that never get any justice, despite hundreds/thousands of victims (many of whom had the bravery to come forward, but were either ignored, called liars or the predator was just too good of a liar and had clout in the community). I read how they operate (grooming).  I read how they will NEVER admit it no matter what.  I read about how kids are often abused by relatives, family friends and even older kids.  I read about Dr George Reardon, who molested/abused hundreds of (at least 500) children in his hospital offices (in a fake study he was running) for 30 years and never paid any real price for it (in 2007, 9 years after he died, a renovator found 50,000+ child pornography photos in a fake wall in the basement of his old house).

It was all very overwhelming, and I lost a little trust of humans along the way, but if that's the price for keeping my boys safe, then I'll cop it any day. Dr Anna Salter is a hero for dedicated her life to exposing the workings of predators.

I'll never leave my kids alone (one-on-one) with almost anyone outside of immediate family (as an extreme example, I have a friend who I've known for 12 years or so - almost 40 years old and never had a girlfriend/wife, etc... I have no reason to suspect he is a pedophile, but he does fit the 'profile' quite well; it won't affect our friendship, but it'll be a cold day in hell before I leave my boys alone with him).  I'll never let my kids go camping with another father (in which case I would go along, or it's properly chaperoned) or go to a coach's house.  Just like in life, you can't adopt a 100% fool-proof approach to protecting your kids, especially as the kids grow older and gain independence, but there are many simple precautions that can reduce your likelihood of being targeted.

Not too long ago, a predator got caught that was giving parents free drugs and ""babysitting"" to groom them. He was taking the kids to stay in fancy hotels, going to theme parks, buying them everything under the sun all while keeping the parents satisfied with their drug of choice. The parents weren't necessarily pimping out their kids bc he also had a young daughter and used her to bait the other girls. The opiod epidemic has busted our town wide open, so lots of ppl are addicted to substances. He'd get his daughter to befriend the ppl who came to buy dope and then ask for them to go on trips with the family (i.e. him and his daughter). 

I just think it's important to keep in mind that the parents get groomed, too. 

""Oh, they didn't say anything when I massaged her back, maybe I'll go a little lower next time...then a little lower, etc""

Because if you do, and you ever attended things with kids, you'd know that they constantly come up to you and touch you as a way of communicating and, further, that kids will sometimes needs comfort, or direction, or help, and that often involves touching. 

And that doesn't even get to family friends! I've known some friends for decades; I've known them before their kids were born, to now when they're reaching adulthood, and we consider each other as family. You better believe I've hugged their kids, and kissed them on the cheek or head, and so on.

4599,du58aks,t1_du4pahv,"If you wouldn't walk up to an adult and do a thing, you shouldn't walk up to a child and do that thing. 

You shouldn't assume children's bodies  are free chattel to do whatever with, just bc you're an adult and they're a child. And the child shouldn't be taught that their bodies are free reign just bc you're an adult and they're a child. 

Like adults who'll kiss children or pick them up without asking. Would you do the same to your adult peers? Then why do it to a child? Do they not have the same bodily rights as adults? Because that's the precedent that's being set with those behaviors. I have to get onto my own father bc he thinks he's my kids' parent. But if I allow him to take them potty, see them while changing, etc they'll never learn that not everybody's supposed to see them in stages of undress. It's the precedent. 

My kids won't even change their shirts in front of their sister and vice versa.  They understand that changing is private and they should respect themselves and the other people around by going somewhere private. They also know to knock before entering rooms, to be asked before someone offers affection, etc. That way the lines aren't blurred as to what's acceptable and what isn't. They'll know right away if their boundaries are being crossed. Idc if it's the pope, if I don't think my kids are being respected as autonomous individuals, I say it. 

Just the other day, my bf was playing with my daughter. He was doing a sniffing thing where he was acting like he was sniffing her neck to tickle her. She was uncomfortable.  He's been their stepparent for a decade, but she needs to know that I won't care to offend whoever I need to, so I told him to stop. It hurt his feelings and I did not care. She was uncomfortable, so I asked him the same thing I said at the beginning of this comment...would you walk up to your adult female friends and sniff their necks to tickle them? He clearly said no. So I asked why it was okay to do that to her. He understood and said he'd base all of his interactions with kids on that bc he'd never thought about it that way. No harm, no foul, and my daughter got a lesson in saying no to uncomfortable touch. 

We are from the south, so it's esp important here. There are ppl who'll walk up and try to kiss your kid right in the mouth, pull them on their laps, pinch at them, just lots of plucking bc kids are seen as ""less than. "" They are to be seen and not heard. That's why I'm so pushy about it. I had my boundaries and rights crossed before I knew what sex even was, so I'm all about preventative maintenance. It's just imperative. ",t3_7x08kq

Title: **Is this child grooming?**

Original Post: 

> Hello, I am writing this post to inquire on an unpleasant memory that has just resurfaced this week. 
> Mostly, I‚Äôm wondering what type of crime was committed. I tried doing some research on this but it‚Äôs very hard for me to understand anything involving the law, it seems. This is also my first time on Reddit so please excuse me if I am not familiar with any of the jargon on here. 
> 
> Back to my story. This all started to happen more than half a decade ago, so it‚Äôs all very fuzzy in my head. When I was around 11, I was contacted by a man of around 25 on an online chatting service named ChatAnGo. Looking back on it, most of the conversations on there weren‚Äôt very innocent in nature, but as a child it‚Äôs not very easy to notice that sorta thing. Anyways, I don‚Äôt know exactly how our conversation started, but we eventually developed a relationship where he would do the following:
> - Tell me about how he was touching himself
> - Tell me how I should touch myself
> - ‚ÄúTeach‚Äù me about various sexual topics (not with the intent of education, this was obviously sexually motivated) 
> - Ask me to find pornography images online and send them to him 
> - Imagine roleplay scenarios where I would be sexually involved with him, and tell me about it all
> - Constantly asking me to send pictures of myself, sometimes in sexy poses, nude or not (I never complied) 
> 
> I was very hesitant throughout, but despite my clear reluctancy, he would encourage me to go through with it all. This relationship lasted a few years, until I slowly started forgetting about the site and eventually left it. Alongside all of this, we would have the occasional normal conversation, which was a reason to keep talking to him. It made everything feel slightly more human.
> 
> Now, you might be thinking, why in God‚Äôs name did you not just block or report him? Well, I was a pushover idiot child. I was smart enough to never give him any info on me, but that‚Äôs about it. Every time he‚Äôd message me, it felt like a drag, but I felt too bad about letting him go. What concerns me is that I remember him mentioning talking to a bunch of other girls (they were all much older than me though), so I feel rather guilty about not being able to stop him from potentially going after more children. 
> 
> I can‚Äôt/don‚Äôt want to take this to court. I‚Äôm an extremely busy college student, and I know for a fact that it would stir up my parents‚Äô marriage (don‚Äôt ask) which has already been on the edge of divorce since I was like 8. That and, I basically remember nothing aside from his username and his job position. 
> 
> What I want, is to be able to put a name on this. Is this child enticement? Or child grooming? Does it still count as child grooming if the trusting relationship is created alongside all of the sexual stuff? Could it be anything else? Or several crimes at once?
> 
> Sorry for the long post and thanks in advance (:

4613,ehzqp2r,t3_ayc4di,"I would consider this child grooming. You were abused by an adult you trusted plain and simple.  It sounds like you need to take some action in order to start moving forward from this abuse.  I suggest you contact Rape Crisis Network Europe https://www.rcne.com/

These types of organizations can give you information about your options and how to go about reporting abuse even if you were not raped in the strictest sense of the word.  Although it has been some time, it's possible that information about your abuser may help to build another case against him.  Even if nothing results from your action, it may help you personally to simply to go through the steps of making the report.

The organization can also help you to find someone to speak to about what happened back then, and you may find speaking to a professional can help you to move forward.

Good luck - I'm sorry you went through this, and it is NOT YOUR FAULT.  I cannot emphasize that enough.  You were a child and the adult was the one responsible for refraining from abuse.",t3_ayc4di
4614,ei04pnr,t3_ayc4di,"While I‚Äôm not sure about the grooming, in many countries soliciting child pornography (asking you for naked pictures) is illegal. 

It sounds to me like understanding what laws were broken is part of the path you are taking towards healing. Another thing you could consider that might help with your healing process, is how would you help any minors in your life (your own children, nieces/nephews/niblings, friends‚Äô kids, kids you may be involved with as part of your job) to avoid a situation like this? And if you knew an adult was doing this, what actions would you take? ",t3_ayc4di
4615,ei0l2fq,t3_ayc4di,"The age thing isn‚Äôt adding up, it must have been longer than 5 years ago if you‚Äôre in college? Doesn‚Äôt matter that much, but five years isn‚Äôt long ->there‚Äôs should still be some evidence this happened lying around. It also means he‚Äôs still likely on the site and active. 


It‚Äôs a pretty twisted story for sure, and I‚Äôm sure he violated a few laws. If you can spend an hour or two trying to dig up a chat log, any kinds of emails exchanged, anything at all that can prove this happened other than your word, I would suggest just telling the cops about it. They might do nothing, they will at the very least file the complaint and put it in a database where it can be indexed vs other crimes and complaints. This way if it happens again to someone else, which it almost for sure will, they will already have a file. This won‚Äôt take much of your time, maybe half a day and might give you peace of mind. 


As others suggested I would seek out a little bit of counselling, you will likely have a program within your college already set up and accessible. Counselling will provide better advice than reddit ever could. I‚Äôve had two or three counselling sessions for other reasons and it‚Äôs almost instant relief the second you get off the phone, it can be life changing for just a few minutes of your time.

Ofc I‚Äôd take them straight to the police, but I‚Äôd have to be aware of it.

4621,ei0rsyg,t1_ei0l2fq,"I‚Äôm in my first year of college, I turned 18 last August. So I guess that‚Äôs about 7 years, maybe. But again I‚Äôm not entirely sure of when this started since it‚Äôs so hazy. Could‚Äôve been more, could‚Äôve been less.

Thing is, since we knew each other for so long, I‚Äôm pretty sure he‚Äôs dead on that website. We eventually moved to Skype, but he‚Äôd died on there too. I then got ahold of his Discord, but again, he died, and I blocked him after realising that I wasn‚Äôt entirely comfortable with the stuff that happened... However, you are right in saying that I can maybe get evidence from this. I just don‚Äôt remember his Discord tag. I‚Äôll try hunting on Skype this weekend ^^

About counselling, I‚Äôm actually studying in France, and mental health here is really not something that people are preoccupied with. I think I‚Äôm fine, this isn‚Äôt something I think about very often, and I have lots of good people around me.

4625,ei0ugfx,t1_ei0rsyg,"Victims of abuse are often struck with poor memories of the events. It‚Äôs some sort of a defence mechanism, I think it‚Äôs called disassociation. 

Not kidding about the counselling thing, it‚Äôs probably free through the college and simple to access. Two or three fifteen minute sessions can make a world of difference. Mental health is likely a primary focus of the school that is mostly invisibly going on in the background. You might feel fine on a day to day basis, because that‚Äôs what you normally feel on a day to day basis. The problem with victims of long term abuse is they have a tendency to have no idea what ‚Äúfeeling fine,‚Äù is. Feeling fine to you and I is completely different to someone who hasn‚Äôt been abused, we might call the same state ‚Äúhappy,‚Äù if that makes any sense. Trust me, your story isn‚Äôt weird or anything either, most people get it: a friend and some taboo moments while you were young and bored, the problem is the effects it can cause later, like at 40.

An IP address is not like a phone number that you keep for a long time. Companies can set up their commercial internet like this, but residential DSL or cable changes IP address from time to time.

There is a chance that the ISP has a record of who had what IP address at what time. The chance is lower that the chat app/website has retained IP records for this long.

If the site still exists, and you still have an account, you could see if the user is still active. The site might then have more current records of his IP. ",t3_ayc4di

When the parents and community spoke up, they were silenced by the police for being racist. Many members of the police force spoke out against this and were branded racists and some lost their jobs.

This went on for years and years and years.

The BBC, up until a few years ago, would not even say ""pakistani men"" in fear of being classed as racist. So they just ignored the problem altogether. 

I can tell you, first hand, from growing up in an area that was 50% and 50% paki, that mass immigration doesnt work. That's not being a racist. In the town i grew up in we had a change of migrants every 10 years or so. Indians, then pakis, then kosovans, then africans and now eastern europeans. With the exception of the Indians, not one of those groups has ever tried to co-mingle or group themselves in with the rest of the population. In reality, they go around making it known that they now own the area and will grab man off of the street to beat them (put them in hospital) or grab girls to rape them.

So yeah, on the totem pole of evilness, aparrently being a racist is worse than gang-raping 13 year old girls.

Whether or not it's a Islamic or Pakistani problem is hard to work out, as it could be due to their large population within the UK in relation to Muslims from other countries. 

>Yeah, I think it was something to do with insisting on factual accuracy. The thing about people who hate Muslims and are trying to push an agenda, is that when confronted with fact, such as scholarly papers on the age of Aisha or passages from Quran which contradict their perceptions, they tend to fuck off (after being abusive for a bit). And are not missed.

And now I'm a racist. Just go and get yourself straight to fuck ya cretin. Downplaying the Muslim element does nothing but breed resentment not only towards Muslims but their defenders as well. Aye, no one should be getting discriminated on because of their colour or creed, but when a particular creed is performing a particular act across a particular country, you've got enough particulars to put together that hmm, maybe something's no right here.

Yes, I do. You keep changing it when your argument gets destroyed by basic logic and fact.

>Links to some specific cases.

That's not what I was asking for and you know it. We all know the word ""widespread"" in this case is not talking about it's geographical locations. It's only used when people are trying to say it happens alot.

>Whether or not it's a Islamic or Pakistani problem is hard to work out, as it could be due to their large population within the UK in relation to Muslims from other countries. 

Right.....So you think these monsters are waiting for census data, doing some maths and going ""Oh boy, there are enough of us now! We can go raping!""? Honestly, doesn't make sense.

>And now I'm a racist. 

Have you left? No? Then the comment in response to you talking about the other guy, in which I talked about people leaving, was probably directed at the person who left. 

Oh and Islam isn't a race. Just by the by.

> Just go and get yourself straight to fuck ya cretin.

No, you can make arguments. Don't drop down to this school yard bullshit. You're better than that.......I hope.

>Downplaying the Muslim element does nothing but breed resentment not only towards Muslims but their defenders as well.

But to do otherwise would be dishonest and frankly, evil. A great man once said that ""Knowledge is the only good and the only evil, ignorance"" and so to allow ignorance and misinformation to be disseminated and perpetuated without challenge would be both dishonest and evil and I refuse to allow that to happen. I simply cannot morally justify it. 

Now look, if you want to challenge the facts, then do so. It either allows that point of view to be publicly defeated by the truth or it allows new information to be brought forward. That is good. But if you want to say that I shouldn't defend the truth because it makes people who refuse to accept the truth and instead perpetuate lies and ignorance, then I can only assume your intent is malicious. 

>Aye, no one should be getting discriminated on because of their colour or creed

Good.

> but when a particular creed is performing a particular act across a particular country, you've got enough particulars to put together that hmm, maybe something's no right here. 

If this trend was replicated across all Islamic countries, then I would agree. But it's not. 

Therefore, all objective people are forced to accept that it cannot be the causal factor. 

Now, to play devil's advocate here, one could make the argument that there are potentially mitigating factors in other Islamic countries, which do not exist in Pakistan. However, we simply don't know that, so at the very worst, we're forced to conclude that we require more data to say that Islam is causal, but we can definitely say that Pakistan's culture (which does not have the appropriate mitigating factors) is causal.",t3_84u5x4

I was even part of his march madness competition that he started after Woody did his. People were kinda annoyed that Woody only accepted youtubers who already had a decent following despite him selling it as a chance for small channels. Nappy did his own, was good fun.

I read this post and it seems to me that everything said besides the accusations against the first guy is not that big of deal. Feels just like that insane post from a while back about boogie. Like, I get it, Nappy did some shitty things, but calling him a pedo and a sociopath over this? That's just insane. He had a thing going with a guy who was 16 and then shortly after turned 17?

1.This comment already betrays your view on this matter, and that you automatically assume that the people guilty of the crimes in the Mirror article you linked above are immigrants. Based on the information in the article about the length that the abuse has been going one (40 years I believe) and the age of the current offenders (they mention them as being in their late teens and throughout their 20's) it's clear that were born in this country and thus are considered British. The article neglects to give us any information on their parents and grandparents and whether or not they were born in the country or if they immigrated. Even if they did, are you saying that we should have denied them entry based on crimes their children or grandchildren would go onto commit?

As for whether certain groups are more likely to make you society worse, I have yet to see any hard evidence that points to one specific group or religion that does so. On the contrary, most studies appear to indicate that such stereotypes and preconceptions are woefully inaccurate. If you have a link to some stats that prove otherwise then please enlighten me. 

These incidents strike me more as gang related then religion related. In almost every case reported the local community has spoken out and condemned the men guilty of the crimes. To say that these cases prove that all Muslims are paedophiles is no different that saying that all [football coaches are paedophiles due to the numerus accusations and investigations against a number of individuals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_football_sexual_abuse_scandal).

The stats for sexual offences in the UK for the year ending 2017 is [here]( https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/articles/sexualoffencesinenglandandwales/yearendingmarch2017). The data released does not appear to break down the nationality of the offenders. The National Archives also contains some [previous reports]( http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105192423/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/taxonomy/search/index.html?newquery=*&nscl=Sexual+Crime&nscl-orig=Sexual+Crime&content-type=publicationContentTypes&sortDirection=DESCENDING&sortBy=pubdate) on sexual offences, but again there‚Äôs nothing that specifies nationality in detail. 

I was able to find [this]( https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/race-and-the-criminal-justice-system-2016) that details the nationality of all those that are arrested, but it does not break down the type the crimes that I can see.

In regards to grooming gangs, there's evidence that the [offenders are mixed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_sexual_abuse_in_the_United_Kingdom). While the recent investigations have focused on Pakistani gangs they are far from the only offenders. Take [Operation Perdition](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-28326128) for example.

Yet there are still people that argue the Bible justifies homophobia and in some cases slavery, even after the reformation. Even then the reformation was a few hundred years ago and a lot has changed since then.

5032,eyvbyxn,t3_cy6fo8,"From the two hour stream here are all the crimes that Greg/Lainey could be charged with.

There is a lot in here that shows that there is corroborating forensic evidence to back her story. There is a significant amount that Greg can be charged with, but more so Lainey without Sarah having much if any additional contact with authorities, they will just subpoena phone records and credit card bills from the source.

First the guardianship power of attorney. This fucks Lainey and Greg, first off Lainey and her had a pre-existing romantic relationship, you can't have a romantic relationship with someone you have a POA of guardianship over. Additional charges would depend on when the POA was dissolved but my guess is that this nullified it altogether. Either way the notary stamp is the seal of doom and Greg should have learned from previous bouts that he is not a lawyer. This would probably carry fines and a jail sentence since this is not the first time Greg would have forged legal documents. As far as fucking your daughter goes, probably would carry a 10-20 year sentence for both of them. They are a married couple he is not legally protected by only Lainey being on the POA.

I mean unpacking that statement there are at least 3 people who would be charged with various offenses (it's a crime in WA to leave your kid with a child sex offender). As far as Lainey goes, transporting a minor across state lines with the intention of having sex with them (regardless if it was to be before or after she was 18) is a violation of the MANN act, I believe Greg would also potentially be charged with this as he most likely paid for the plane ticket ton get her out there leaving behind necessary forensic evidence. This alone would get them at least 5-10 and they would lose custody of their kids.

She smoked weed in their house, on their dime, too which would actually be another charge of contributing to the delinquency of a minor. That would be another 1-10 years, depends on the state again this is easy to trace from ATM records (weed stores are mostly cash) and some credit card histories.

There is a spattering of various child abuse and endangerment charges mixed in, mostly on Greg's part but Sarah would have to come forward to add those in and there is a chance that a court finds them guilty on other counts and not guilty on these counts. It is more likely if both Billie and Sarah came forward that the charges would stick because they may have witnessed different parts of the same events. I consider this unlikely and they should bear in mind that if they choose to appear most states do not require them to appear in court on the same day as the perpetrator. Either way this adds a few years for extra offenses and would be more of a factor in seeking a maximum sentence on all charges for both Lainey and Greg.

If Sarah wanted to sue for emotional distress or financial damages (if she wasn't in school she may have these and that would be an additional count on Greg and Lainey of contributing to the delinquency of a minor), her statements have not been damaged by posting this so long as they are true and she can retell them the same in court.

There is a question of whether Greg filmed them having sex. Most likely he did and he will delete this evidence which is stupid because 1) it can be recovered and 2) destroying the evidence is another crime. These are Greg only crimes and because it is genuinely incest porn if the POA is valid, this is not only evidence of other crimes but also a crime in and of itself probably 10 years on this one maybe an extra 2 if he is actually as dumb as I think he is.

Then there are the assault rifles Greg has been buying up, add that in and most likely it will be another endangerment count, possibly 2 depends on how his guns are stored.Also I'm not sure what they are doing with their kids when all this love hypercubeism is taking place, could be additional endangerment or neglect charges.

I'd guess this is 25-40 years for Greg and probably 15-25 for Lainey, assuming she will choose to be charged as a woman but if not same term as Greg. If either Sarah or Billie actually testify at the trial and sentencing I'd expect maximum sentence but either way they are both fucked, rich child sex offender celebrities do not last long in prison in prison.

Multiple statements indicate Greg and Lainey's motives, rationalizations and state of mind and would give many leads for questioning Greg and Lainey. As soon as they are separated they will turn on each other in questioning, not that it will matter since by the time the questioning occurs they will have enough for a trial.  The motives and mindset lead to additional crimes of witness/victim intimidation.  This occurred multiple times so my guess is it would be more than one count.

Either way they are fucked because [https://family.findlaw.com/child-abuse/checklist-are-you-a-mandatory-reporter-of-child-abuse.html](https://family.findlaw.com/child-abuse/checklist-are-you-a-mandatory-reporter-of-child-abuse.html)  All it takes is one person in one of these career fields seeing this video and his life is basically over...  Oh wait I'm on that list, silly me.

No idea what that lady in the video was saying, this wouldn't have gotten reported if it wasn't posted here, because if if wasn't posted here odds are it just would have been Youtubers who saw it. Most of the statements will just get corroborated with forensic evidence anyway in a criminal hearing.  As far as collecting, if Greg has engaged in massive tax fraud then the IRS gets the money first also any money owed on wetlands damage gets paid first.  If Greg is selling CP (there are reasons like getting in contact with Robert Ripple and other pedos that lend credence to this theory) then that is a whole neither can of worms, but it does mean he will have the money to pay.  A judge could turn over Greg and Lainey's YouTube accounts to the victims because they were used in the commission of a crime and they are income producing assets in addition a judge could freeze or confiscate any assets used in the commission of the crimes including his house, cars, bank accounts these could be turned over to the victims in a civil suit.  


While I understand Sarah's apprehension to step forward the reward could basically be over half a million dollars plus income producing assets if she does.",t3_cy6fo8

If a mother is assumed to be good in intent and she says she needs to see your penis, you assume it's for the best. I mean, I almost never recall hearing about female teachers with students. Older women didn't go for younger men, especially adolescents. On top of that, my mother was 30 when she started and devastating in her looks. Who would believe me if she was wrong? I never stopped to think that I was also a victim of overt sexual abuse with a female babysitter when I was five and six years old. I never told anyone until my first wife. What my mother has done, is infinitely worse and more destructive",t3_9tmky7
5125,e98ms7r,t1_e98lwub,"I'm sorry to hear that. I'm glad, though, that you aren't being used as a punching bag.

I would like to fix things with my mother. She would be capable. But I know with all my heart that right now, she honestly sees her behavior as the best thing that could happen to me. She thinks that because she has a drive like mine and we're somewhat similar in personality, she did things to protect and love me. Since really no one else knows anything about all of this, there's still her reputation to protect her and my limitations from upbringing (I don't want to burn her at all). She sees it as her being in the best position to keep my sex under control and she feels like she is not incestuous, that this is a whole separate thing. And she has convinced herself that whatever pleasure and desire she caused is a marvelous thing because she is truly to be trusted. Even if it would be incest, she'll crack eggs to make that omlet. In truth, she has done to herself something worse than what she has done to me. Her trigger is way more sensitive than mine. ",t3_9tmky7
5126,e98nx3x,t1_e98nofm,"My heart breaks the way you describe it, but I know. Your mother had the ultimate privilege of protecting you from harm, and instead she harmed you and ultimately destroyed your foundations of being able to gauge what is safe and what isn't. That's what my father did to me, but to a lesser degree because he sexualized me in a different way. Ugh. ",t3_9tmky7
5127,e98pnt3,t1_e98nx3x,"God, I am so sorry. I'm a father of seven, five are girls, and I can't imagine hunting my princesses in any way. I try to show them how a good man loves and acts. I can barely conceive of what made him do that to you, but I imagine it's probably something like what happened with my mother. She never ever would have thought it would end up happening, but I know that it did to a large extent because of her inability to understand borders, privacy, and her recklessness. After so long engaging in all of these little sexually tinged battles with me, she basically exposed herself to so much stimulus and curiosity that when she had her drive pick up, it found its way right to me. I was safe. I was ignorant. My mom, come to find out, in telling me all these things about ""mothers"" really told me about her. Out of her own mouth I heard her say that mothers had a natural curiosity for her son's adolescent growth, to include the privates. What she meant was that she did because she was not around males when she went through puberty. She wanted to fill in the gaps in her experience. Were it not for my being in the perfect place for what she needed right then, I don't doubt she never would have given it a thought. But you can only chase a teen boy around talking about his penis so much and playing stupid games that get you close and give you enough of an idea of what he's got down there and you think it's pretty awesome...

The British don‚Äôt even classify the perpetrators by ethnicity, instead they often say ‚ÄúAsian‚Äù when reporting the crimes, much unlike here in the States. 

Obviously we know that clergy are all a bunch of child molesters, but at the same time Pakistani Brits are doing equally heinous things at higher rates.",t3_by3ndm
5135,eqda1xq,t3_by3ndm,"Are you from the U.K. because if you were you would know that the individuals who committed these heinous acts against vulnerable children got away with it for so long precisely because of their ethnicity?

I‚Äôve always felt that political correctness is another word for decency, but taken to extremes it can cross over to lunacy and that happened to a degree in the U.K. and Rotherham.  The authorities knew what was going on, but the police were afraid that they would be accused of racism and the morally bankrupt council didn‚Äôt want to damage relations with the Asian voters.  The Rotherham gangs used their ethnicity as a shield.  There were other factors like sexism and class discrimination coming into play.

One thing the media misrepresented was the ethnicity of the victims - for a long time I thought all the victims were white (for want of a better word), but the gangs targeted Asian girls as well.

You‚Äôre not wrong about there being paedophiles in all walks of life, but I don‚Äôt think British Asians are being unfairly targeted by the media or police, but after Rotherham there is a subconscious perception among a minority of the British public that Asian men are generally perverts which is unfair.

Many of these girls are groomed by older men, in their twenties, who ply them with booze and gifts and act like a sort of older pseudo boyfriend. That is when they start getting passed around and emotionally/physically abused if they try to leave.

There are quotations from police officers describing them as ""little slags"" and stating that they are consenting parties, despite being only 14 years old. This response is highly charged with the kind of class based discrimination which runs through the core of British culture. Are you from the UK? Understand that our class culture is almost a caste system and your social background highly determines how you will be perceived and treated.

The ""afraid to be called racist"" line is total bullshit. The police in many of these cases allowed their preconceived notions about how all unruly girls from council estates are little slappers and trouble makers get in the way of doing their due diligence. The racism excuse panders to the current ""PC/SJW culture gone mad"" zeitgeist and so is a handy diversionary tactic for them.

One minute the police are being accused of systemic racism with things like stop and search and the next we are to believe that they are actually hyper sensitive to being perceived as racist.

Just like in christianity where marriages and divorces tied in with both civil and religious backgrounds, and also socially (think of the feuds people get into).  A marriage happens in a church, and also in the state, and also in the community. As does a divorce.    
Muslims going through family break ups and breakdowns need arbitrators between the families and their religion to make sure the divorce, or other family disturbances (eg inheritances) is all done by the book in their religion and also under civil law too.  It's an advisory and arbitration panel for muslims.

>They say things like 'rape is already illegal therefor rape culture cannot exist '

The argument is much more nuanced than that, as it also points out how much rape is reviled by society and in prison by other criminals and the issues about proving rape legally speaking, rather than police ignoring rape as a crime because of tacit approval or lack of caring about it.  Bureaucracy is a factor in police failures in terms of prosecution as well, as is the general issue of the trade offs in the legal system and protections for the accused making prosecution of all crimes somewhat difficult (IIRC the conviction rate for people accused of murder is less than 50%).  

Oh and:
>**(The review) warned that one girl had suggested boys were among the victims, and that the sexual exploitation of male victims is likely to be under-reported and hidden.**

>The review said that while perpetrators‚Äô individual beliefs are not known, they ‚Äúall appear to come from a non-white, predominantly Asian/British minority ethnic culture or background‚Äù ‚Äì as in Rotherham, Rochdale and Oxfordshire, while a grooming gang in Bristol were from a Somali background.

>A judge concluded that the defendants ‚Äúselected their victims not because of their race, but because they were young, impressionable, naive, and vulnerable‚Äù, including young girls and women with learning difficulties and mental health issues.

Part of the reason the police didn't act was the victim selection resulted in the police considering them 'unreliable witnesses' and apparently thinking about the likely difficulty in prosecution due to the angles of attack for defense lawyers.

>Before 2014, police were responding to incidents on an ad hoc basis, with efforts by authorities trying to persuade victims to keep away from the abusers and change their behaviours.

>The review found the approach led to ‚Äúconsideration of deterrent punishments of victims for being drunk and disorderly or for making false allegations when accounts were changed‚Äù. 

>The review found that before Operation Sanctuary started in 2014, perpetrators in Newcastle were not consistently investigated and disrupted as victims were unwilling to make complaints.

>‚ÄúHowever, once the true extent of the problem became apparent, the police, the Crown Prosecution Service, the city council and partners across the city put in place a range of measures to disrupt, arrest and imprison offenders while supporting victims regardless of whether they were able to give evidence in court or not,‚Äù Mr Spicer said.

5364,dvitopi,t1_dvit9ie,"> And anti-feminists complain about whenever a feminist discusses rape and rape culture. 

In my experience, only when said feminists use rape/rape culture as ways to blame men. I'm an MHRA and have discussed ways in which rape culture results in men getting raped and is sometimes promoted by women (including a number of specific feminists) and I've never had blowback. 

>They say things like 'rape is already illegal therefor rape culture cannot exist ' 

Slight strawman, but to be fair that's because MHRAs typically take the most extreme, Radical Second Wave understanding of ""rape culture"" (i.e. a culture where rape is condoned as a weapon of sexual terrorism to subjugate women), rather than a softer understanding of the term (i.e. to refer to specific cultural expectations/tropes/ideas/memes/artifacts... not necessarily entire cultures as a whole... which can (even if unintentionally) increase the chance of rape occurring or rape perpetrators getting away with rape). I'm more than happy to accept that the second kind of ""rape culture"" exists... but ""rape culture"" in the first sense of the term isn't a fair descriptor of the modern West. Western modernity does not think its okay to rape 'uppity women' to 'put them in their place.'

>Yet here we have a example of a western nation turning a blind eye on rape even when it involved children.

This truly is an atrocity. An unmitigated atrocity against the victims and my thoughts are with them. 

But if there was any kind of rape culture implicated in these atrocious acts, it is rape culture of the second kind. As the report states:

>Authorities failed to keep details of abusers from Asian communities for fear of ‚Äúracism‚Äù

And the story immediately below which is connected to this grooming scandal...

>her 26-year-old abuser Azhar Ali Mehmood...

We finally get down to a ""timeline"" which says that...

>Vulnerable Telford girls are targeted by groups of mainly Asian men.

So we know the rapists are mainly Asian. Which is a term used in the UK to be inclusive of West Asians (Indians and Pakistanis) and often Middle Easterners as well. I don't need to point out the obvious here, but in this situation, the fear of being thought of as racist meant people didn't come forward to save the girls. 

Here's a proposition you may find inflammatory: in some situations, political correctness can be rape culture (of the second definition). ",t3_83lwuh

Yet here we have a example of a western nation turning a blind eye on rape even when it involved children.

As an antifeminist, the thing that bugs me when ""most feminists"" discuss rape culture is they act like this is a phenomena that women primarily suffer.  In fact, the opposite is true.

Rape culture, if we're going to define it like that, is MOSTLY about a societal blind spot regarding the perpetration by women.  Men are told they are to be thankful to be raped by women, and if they didn't enjoy it they're gay, even when it's little boys raped by grown women.

It's played in movies for laughs (I.E. Wedding Crashers).  Victims are told they must be thankful.  They must be appreciative.  In the movies (I.E. Wedding Crashers) they are to marry their rapists and live happily ever after.

THIS is rape culture.

Now, there's some rape subcultures that women suffer from, particularly being ""thankful"" that football star raped her, and that's just as horrible, but women do not suffer near the rape culture that men do on the average.  Yet, it's generally presented in the opposite way.

Now, the extant case is certainly horrible, and there seems to be a number of police and social workers that should *also* be prosecuted, but let's not pretend there's no reason for ""antifeminists"" groan whenever rape culture is brought up.

Here we are talking about broken legs yet you keep saying that it could be worse, you could be shot six times.

You won't for whatever reason do the logically consistent thing and call out a fallacy committed by the anti-feminists who do this even when met with evidence of it happening, and instead indulge in it yourself.

Anti-feminists complain about rape culture for the reasons you admitted: It's a cheap game of oppression olympics that seeks to tear down the opposition rather than construct anything worthwhile. If that wasn't the case, you wouldn't be set on denying rape culture when it isn't what you want to talk about at the moment. 

>Even if YOU don‚Äôt use it that way, enough have to taint it.

I‚Äôm not huge on specific terms. I acknowledged, as you will note in the history, that to the extent rape culture is a valid term, it‚Äôs suffered more by men than women. That doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not suffered by women. It used to be suffered equally - but we‚Äôve worked hard on the women‚Äôs side and had good success from where we started all things considered. (although the extant case proves, not perfect success). 

However, in common usage, it‚Äôs often deployed only to talk about the suffering of women and used to push even more sexist policy. Which is why antifeminists groan. 

Use it or don‚Äôt use it, but don‚Äôt get upset when people groan reflexively. Just like you do when people start talking about ‚Äúsmall government‚Äù or ‚Äúthink of the children‚Äù. 

>This is fallacious. Like I said, while it may trigger some response from you, I fail to see why you would make that our problem.

It seems to me it doesn't matter how it is used, anti-feminists will groan when it is uttered. Even when there is no evidence that rape culture is being used in this way.

>Use it or don‚Äôt use it, but don‚Äôt get upset when people groan reflexively. Just like you do when people start talking about ‚Äúsmall government‚Äù or ‚Äúthink of the children‚Äù.

5559,eotar53,t3_bt2n4w,"The hypothetical moral ok here is going to come from a scratch the surface only approach +  a rather cruel world that doesn't care/couldn't help if it did.

 Let's go fiction. Say you had a vampire. Count Snacula. Count Snacula lives in the shittiest part of the Sudan/ name your hell hole. Count Snacula has a shit ton of gold bucks because he's 1000 yrs old and and some point saved/invested in something. Count Snacula goes to the village,it's the worst place you can imagine, kids are gnawing on gopher skulls and stuff. Stabbing each other with sharpened sticks because they want that gnaw,alpha kid gets the gnaw after all. He  buys 12 kids for a few goats from dear old mom and dads. He takes them to his Snaccastle. He gives them chocolate bars and lets them ride the carousel, because of course he's got a carousel. Pretty happy kids. Except on Mondays and Thursdays when he drains them to a fucking raisin,all the screams and accompanying resistance that goes with it. He moves his pocket watch over their eyes and goes this never happened you were having a daymare. They forget, nurse Igor gives them an IV, they heal up and get back to their happy princely lives. Till next Monday or Thursday for the rest of their mortal lives.

Now how wrong is this? Any place with orphans to just hand out is already some kind of super broke for the kids p.o.v at least. (they are toast on their own).   

Do you think it is important to address the problem instead of dealing with the symptoms like having kids with no where to go?  Or make a fucking deal with a  human vampire? Is the vampire the good guy here? Does the upbringing/mesmerizing that hey it's normal or hey it didn't happen silly lessen the negative aspects of making a deal with a fucking vampire?

Do you just hate the fucking vampire, burn him up, phew that's done, nap time! and walk away leaving the kids to gnaw as they may?

I think the very fact you would have such a situation with a vampire showing up would demonstrate you/ the culture got a little monster of indifference that needs burning up too. The vampire (sex daddy)  isn't the problem, he's a side effect/symptom. Do burn him, but the fires got more to do, else you'll just get another.",t3_bt2n4w

They may not agree that it should be done out of one's own kindness, and may agree that some kind of exchange is due depending on the quality of life they were provided.

Let's switch out sex for money.

Let's say you convince your child to give you all the money she earns and be happy for it. 

She earned that money but is happily giving it away. Coworkers get suspicious that she may be being taken advantage of. 

A tip-off to the police might start an investigation leading to the discovering of the grooming. 

On the surface this may seem like it's perfectly legal, but with  such a strong dspendency, it will set off some flags that will lead to the entire story being spilled if she doesn't spill it on her own.

""Dad uses my money to take care of me""

#

A little abstractly, having an equal as a subordinate without knowledge of her autonomy would count as abuse. 

With knowledge of where she is in the world, knows her rights and what she is capable of, then it shouldn't be an issue because she is a consenting adult.

> LONDON - About 115 million boys were married off as children with one in five wed before they turned 15, according to the first United Nations&#039; study to track the prevalence of child grooms.

> The U.N. children&#039;s agency UNICEF analyzed marriage and population data across 82 countries and found the Central African Republic had the highest prevalence of child grooms at 28%, followed by Nicaragua at 19% and Madagascar with 13%. UNICEF said children married young tended to leave school, have limited economic opportunities, and be more vulnerable to abuse and mental health problems than those who married later.

> If all girls finished secondary school, more than 50 million child marriages could be prevented by 2030, children&#039;s charity Save the Children said in an October report.

This story touches on so many aspects of modern life (consent, race relations, police/gov't accountability, responsibilities of the media) and is very close to many of your personally outspoken principles. 

I think the scope and severity of this story deserves a deep dive, even if it is done as a standalone later on this week. The comment linked by kittenstixx is a good start but please look into the way in which the UK police have failed to protect their children repeatedly and the ways in which the UK gov't is doing more work to dodge controversy than help in any way (Patrick Rock).

Quotations from the Mirror article

‚ÄúNight after night, I was forced to have sex with multiple men in disgusting takeaways and filthy houses.

""I must have been getting the morning after pill from a local clinic at least twice a week but no one asked any questions.

‚ÄúI fell pregnant twice and had two abortions. Hours after my second termination, I was taken by one of my abusers to be raped by more men.

""The worst moment came just after my 16th birthday when I was drugged and gang raped by five men.

""Days later, the ringleader turned up at my house and told me he‚Äôd burn it down if I breathed a word of what had happened.‚Äù

I could see purposes for this question being as diverse as a secret pedo ring sting, or first round data collection that could lead some of the respondents being headhunted by child trafficking rings contracting facebook to find ruthless scumbags. Facebook certainly seems to have the power to do either, and we know with the 2016 election they were courting Russian advertisers for explicitly illegal targeted advertising to US persons concerning the election.
Maybe the point was just to see how much push-back they get from people specifically saying that they aught to report such things to law enforcement, in order to help them decide if it was worth it--in terms of public trust of the corporation--to make some official procedure for reporting these things to law enforcement, rather than just treating it like any other kind of unwanted material.",t3_826km0

5802,d4uihgn,t3_4qnfci,"The downvoting of Ezria criticism caught my eye, too. Only yesterday I pointed out that when I revisited a thread one hour later, some fanatic downvoted every single comment on it. It's crazy how people act. 

I agree with you that Ezra is more than just sketchy. When he had a secret relationship with his underage student, I thought that his behavior was inexcusable. How could a grown ass man allow himself to start dating his 16 year old student? But the show did a good job with convincing us that their love was true and meant to be. I reminded myself multiple times that when they have met neither of them knew that Ezra would become her teacher and that he was under the impression that she was older. I tried to say to myself: Hey, you can't choose who you love, right? But that weird feeling stayed.

When we learned that he seduced her on purpose in order to get information and that he very well knew how old she was, I was disgusted. It was official, he belonged in jail. How could an adult do something like that to a child? At 16, you are practically still a child. He seduced her for his own gain, conned her into falling in love with him so that he could write a book about her and her friends. He had secret hiding places full of pictures of his underage students! He hid in the shadows and took pictures of them! He hacked their security systems! He turned her against her friends and tried to convince her that they were crazy for trying to point out his sketchiness! How can you come back from that?!

Aria was a young girl and that cycle of secret keeping and pushing herself to keep up with an older guy really damaged her. Whenever Ezra calls for her, she is right there to help him, to clean up his mess or just keep him company. She is acting like he is her knight in shining armor, like he is this really nice guy, but he is not. 

Sure, the show has tried to redeem him. They made him take a bullet for Aria. And he helped to save her from the dollhouse. But for me, that is not enough. That shows that he cares about her, yes, but it doesn't make all of the disgusting stuff he has done magically go away. The show has done a really good job with convincing us how sketchy and sick Ezra is, and they can't take that back just because they decided that it was a red herring. Those images of his creepy look and smile will always pop up in my mind when I see Ezria kissing. I just can't help it.

As to why Ezria has such a huge following: I don't know, but I guess it has something to do with that classic idea of ""they love each other so much that they just cannot live without each other, even though they know their love is not allowed"". But even if the forbidden love angle floats your boat, how can you overlook this huge betrayal? If he had cheated on Aria, people would be outraged, crying that nothing could possibly make up for this, but what Ezra did to Aria was way worse. It was the ultimate betrayal. How can you trust a person after something like that? Would you really want to raise children with such a person?

Why do people overlook all of this? Well, the actors (Lucy and Ian) are close in age IRL and that is why they don't look weird together; they look like a normal couple. If we would have seen your typical 16 year old student kissing her teacher in his mid 20s, things wouldn't look so normal anymore. Plus, Ian Harding doesn't look like a predator. And let's face it, little girls are drawn to him because they think that he looks cute. If Ezra would be played by your average teacher (even when he is in his early to mid 20s), Ezria would be a lot less popular and people would be more willing to admit how weird and wrong their relationship really is.

I wish Ezra could have been the real A. Aside from the fact that this reveal was just awesome, it would teach young viewers that you should NOT trust the guy who hits on younger girls, manipulates you for his own gain and abuses his authority. It would have set a good (and realistic) example. But well, the season of romance is more important.",t3_4qnfci

His book? Is just completely baffling to me, he what? Wasn't aware of how predatory his actions throughout the entire show have been? 

Most of the pathetic and cliched English teachers self insert themselves into their feaux deep 'lit' about a professor falling for their student. He's not ONLY doing that, but he's the walking English teacher cliche personified because he's lived it and he doesn't even recognize that that's exactly what he is.

Aria was 17, and a 17 year old girl is NOT a kid anymore, for God's sake.

It isolated her to a point where Ezra often was the only person she could be truthful with, the only person where she could let down her guard because she didn't have to concentrate to not let anything slip when she was with him. That obviously hurt Aria, yes, but it also hurt the people she withdrew from, because they had no idea what was suddenly wrong.

Agreed that Ezra should've been the real A though. Would've made a lot of sense. He's such a creep. His book really showed what a predatory mind he has. I mean, we could always see that through his actions, but there were times when the camera showed pages of the drafts of his book, and that really showed a terrifying glimpse into his mind. I remember he said about Ali that she had ""the capacity to touch you as softly as only a child could"" which means I call absolute bullshit on him not having known Ali's age. Oh and you could see how he targeted Aria specifically because he thought she felt out of place in Rosewood and because of the issues she had from her dad cheating and making her cover it up, and he said something about how he thought she ""tends to be attracted to older (more worldly) men"" which just show how absolutely conscious and intentional his grooming was. And how he specifically figured out stuff Aria liked so that he could get closer to her.

5914,d4vd8h4,t1_d4uove0,"OK, whoa. What's wrong with saying a 15 year old is hot? That's like saying they're beautiful or attractive, just using slang. It's perfectly acceptable to acknowledge someone's appearance, no matter their age, mental state, or relation to you. Yes, acting on it or propositioning said 15 year old would absolutely be wrong, but complimenting someone's appearance is not sexual harassment or inappropriate behavior. Plenty of girls have physically developed enough to look like a mature woman by 15, so it's not weird at all to think they look attractive. Your actions decide your character, not your thoughts. 

Just in case someone gets worked up, I'm not talking about cat-calling. I'm talking about complimenting someone in a respectful way, which absolutely can include calling someone hot.

But yeah, I'm with you that the standards for behavior in fiction are much different than in real life.

That's why threads such like this or so many annoyed comments about the issue pop up lately - it has gotten really annoying.

Mary Kay Letourneau has been married to her former victim for... more than 10 years now.  Back in the day, that was a HUGE scandal.  HUGE.

Now we've got a show w/ a girl not that much older (being portrayed by a woman in her 20's b/c it would be illegal to have a kid the age of the character in the role) fornicating w/ her teacher, and was there even any kind of ""outcry""?  There may have been, and I just missed it.

And yeah - Ezra doing all that was **super** creepy & disturbing.  It was great.  It was that character's best moments.  One of the best reveals, for me.

( I upvoted you.  But seeing as how my post got knocked down by like 15 points in the past minute.... it won't help you. lol  )",t3_4qnfci
5935,d4uq2gt,t1_d4uk0q0,"Let me preface this by saying I don't even like Ezria. I find them annoying together but I find all the couples annoying together. I do like Ezra. I think the only character I really don't like is Toby, again because he's annoying. 

So first of all it's just a show. I don't know when people started treating shows like real life, or like they should strictly adhere to our modern standards of right and wrong, but it's getting ridiculous. Fictional shows should not be expected to portray everything in a positive or morally acceptable light just because some people might be dumb enough to think that seeing it on tv makes it ok. Force shows to all fit into a politically correct box and it'll be the end of good fiction on tv. 

This is how the people on here who have a problem with Ezra/Ezria treat this show. It just doesn't make sense to me to get *so* upset about a fictional relationship. People on here talk shit all the time about twitter fans who can't tell the difference between real life and the show when they're freaking out on the actors. But it seems to me like the people who freak out about hating Ezra/Ezria have just as much of a hard time telling real life from fiction. It gets to this point of almost bullying Ezra/Ezria fans into silence because they're constantly being berated for not agreeing with the majority of the sub. You very very rarely see a pro Ezra/Ezria post or even a comment but anti Ezra is a constant on here. In the past I've been called a ""victim blamer"" ""defensive just bc you probably love your teacher"" (I'm 29) ""not in your right mind"" ""disgusting"" just for talking about this. Which is why I usually try to avoid it, and I'm sure why other people who don't hate them do too. 

I think people over exaggerate about Ezra's creepiness and the severity of what he did with the book and with their relationship. I see people on here all the time saying things that just aren't true. Making Ali younger than she actually was when she and Ezra were friends. Saying they had a romantic relationship when both characters have said they didn't. Acting like Ezra knew Ali was 14 when we know that isn't true. Saying Ezra was obsessed with Ali in a sexual way, when he was just writing a book. Saying he followed the girls with video cameras, when he never did that. Saying he stalked the girls for years/while he and Aria were together, when he never actually did that. Saying he manipulated and used her throughout their relationship, when we have no evidence for that. Seeing stuff like that *all* the time just gets annoying because it's just making stuff up for the sole purpose of hating on a character more. 

Now to the law and morality of age and teacher relationship. To start with the legal age of consent in PA is 16. PA does have a ""corruption of minors"" law which comes into play when there's a larger age difference or an imbalance of power like a student teacher relationship. However those cases are actually investigated on a case by case basis to find out the true nature of the relationship and if there's anything seedy going on. 

The legal status of PA aside, I don't look at age as so black and white as others on this sub. The US allows states to pick the legal age of consent so you can be in one state where the legal age is 16, cross the border to another state where it's 18 and suddenly your relationship is illegal. To me, 16 is a good age to be considered old enough to make decisions about sex. I think it's a little dumb to put so much weight on arbitrary ages randomly picked by old white men as the legal age of consent. Young women should be allowed to make their own decisions about their bodies. 

I think the ""corruption of a minor"" law is a good idea just to have in place to catch those cases that are an abuse of power or whatever. But like I said before they should be looked at case by case so you aren't throwing everyone in jail just for having a gf a few years younger. 

Student teacher relationships should absolutely be prohibited in real life. But this is a tv show and we should not be treating it as real life. however, just like age of consent, I think student teacher relationships should be looked at case by case. This is where the ""corruption of a minor"" comes in play. There are definitely some creeps who will use their power to manipulate students. But I guarantee not every case is like that especially when you have 22/23 year old teachers in high schools with barely any age difference between their students. I have a friend who had a relationship with a teacher and I've seen other people on here say they have had one. *Not every case is as black and white as this sub wants it to be.* You're bound to have *some* relationships develop that are mutual and loving, Just like Ezria has been portrayed as. 

People on here keep calling Ezra a predator but he's never displayed characteristics like that. Yes, he knew who Aria was when they first met because he was writing a book and that's a bit creepy, but he did stop writing it as soon as they started dating. He wasn't writing it the whole time like some people on here would have you believe.

 He also tried to end things with her several times at the beginning but Aria kept pursuing him and pressuring him. Right at the very beginning of their relationship he started looking for other jobs so he wouldn't be her teacher. Again, it was Aria who freaked about him leaving the high school because she thought he was leaving her. He still did leave the high school right at the beginning of their relationship though. And when he eventually came back to the high school he told her they had to break up. So I really don't get why people freak out so much about this when it's clear he hasn't been ok with the student teacher thing from the start and has done things to make sure he wasn't her teacher. And the show has never *ever* portrayed him as using his power as her teacher over her. 

So again I don't know where people get this stuff from. Just being her teacher doesn't make him a predator especially when we know he took steps to correct that power dynamic. Just being older doesn't make him a predator especially when people on here really like Aria with Jason, or Spencer with Wren, who have the same age differences. Just writing the book doesn't make him a predator especially when we know he ended the book as soon as they started dating and didn't start it again til after they broke up. 

Finally, I think it's a little messed up that people still treat Aria like she's a child and can't make her own decisions even now that she's an adult. I completely understand being critical of the relationship when she's a teenager but when it's years later and the person is now an adult and still says that the relationship was not ""predatory"" then people should stop. She's a grown woman and she can think about her past relationships critically and decide for herself if it was inappropriate or not. She doesn't need strangers telling her she's a victim or that she's wrong about her own experience. That's just taking away her autonomy.

I know I'm forgetting something but this is already so long. I've said all of these things many many times before, so I'm not going to get into a huge debate about this *again*. I've said my peace and basically think the anti Ezra people just need to chill out a little and remember it's a show. Relax with the fact that not everyone hates Ezria the way you do and that not everyone sees things as black and white as you.

Anyway, I honestly don't know how you keep watching this show if you're so sensitive towards this issue. In the last episode, we saw Hanna avoiding to go to the police after being kidnapped and tortured. This also sends quite a bad message to ""the thousands of impressionable children"". It also sent the message that you can blind a schoolmate and then never go to jail for that. Or murder Shana in self-defence and never be accounted for her death. You say it's not the same thing, but these are very serious crimes that were never taken seriously in the show. In your view, everything this show has to offer is a huge, gigantic, bad example to the impressionable kids.

Well, not so much with Ezra but with her as her victim was considerably younger than Aria and she was his teacher in second grade as well. 

Ezra and Aria are closer in age.  The only real problem if it's just a student/teacher relationship where ages are 16 and 22 is the student teacher relationship. Most states have 16 as the legal age for consent of sexual relations.  Sixteen is still young and it is WRONG in teacher/student roles as one has power over the other...... 

You know I don't even know if the acceptance is widespread though. Mary Kay went to jail for several years, her victim, now husband requested the no contact order be revoked once he was 18. I remember when it was in the news and a reporter interviewed a neighbor who said it sucked, she didn't like it, but the boy was an adult now and the woman had served her time and she wished people would leave them (and the neighbors) alone. I mean she didn't say anything that wasn't true even if it is disgusting. And it was a pretty decent scandal, it did make national headlines and tv even if reporters weren't really able to speak to the couple.

It makes a difference with Ezria because Ezria is seen as ""endgame"" for so many people. He's made to look like Prince Charming - Jason, Ian, and/or Wren are not seen in the same light Ezra is.

I understand that others may not feel the same way, but it hit me close to home, and I was blindsided when the writers painted Aria and Ezra's relationship out to be a fairytale even after the book reveal.

I'm not complaining about Shana's murder or Jenna's blinding being romanticized because they weren't.  I didn't feel that they glorified in any way.  Sure it's not the best message to send to kids that ""hey there won't really be any repercussions for blinding your classmate"" but that's totally normal.

I apologize if I came across as someone who thought every ridiculous thing that's ever happened on this show was complete BLASPHEMY AND SHOULD NOT BE TOLERATED.  Those weren't at all my intentions.  By saying that I disagree with the way the show romanticized Ezra and Aria's relationship, I didn't mean for you to take it that I was hypersensitive to everything that was bad in the show.  I mean, it's not a murder mystery show without murder, right?  

I would also like to add that I never referred to Ezra as a rapist or pedophile.  I completely understand that those aren't words to be used lightly, and since I don't know the details of their relationship, I didn't use them.

Edit: about your GOT comment, I doubt many parents would let their young kids watch that.  It's TV-MA for a reason.  PLL is different.  I wouldn't be surprised if parents let their 8 year olds watch.  Again, I wasn't calling for anything like TV censorship, I just think that the writers should have taken a different path with Ezra and Aria's relationship, or at least have called him out on his actions sooner.",t3_4qnfci

Statutory rape and other sex crimes shouldn't be glamorized or excused on television; too many people have had their lives ruined by predators who abuse their power and authority over them.  Teenagers are impressionable and going through a lot of emotional and physical changes; often their mental abilities outpace their emotional ones and that can leave them vulnerable to predators who appeal to them as intellectual equals.  However, no matter how smart they are, they're still kids, and they still need time to grow up and figure out who they are, and an adult--especially an authority figure--preying on them is vile and wrong.  No matter how sophisticated a teenager seems, it's still wrong.  Ezra is a predator and should not be romanticized as anything else.

6007,d4v6dfb,t1_d4v3fuz,"I see your point. Personally, I see the Ezra book storyline as an example of bad writing. I mean, they needed a shock revelation to keep viewers watching the show but, at the same time, they knew they would lose Ezria fans by making Ezra A so they came out with the book story. I wish they just left him out of the mystery plot completely or made him A.

However, they later spent many episodes with Aria dealing with her feelings after discovering this and hating on him, then he got shot to protect her and I think this is how the writers think he got redeemed. In this view, I can tolerate their relationship now, in the sense that he admitted being an ass and almost died, and Aria has decided to forgive him. Now, as an adult woman, she doesn't want an outsider like Liam to judge something that she went through and only she can see as it was. I think in real life no one would forgive someone who used them to write a book, but well, I count this as another unrealistic thing among the many on the show. For example I didn't like how Spencer got back to Toby immediately after discovering that he was on the A team to protect her: she ended up in Radley after the body-stunt and while he may have intended to help the girls his behaviour was still inexcusable.

Also, I am very sorry to hear about your friend, it's awful. Maybe I sounded biased for the opposite reason, I know a person who got married with a former teacher who is just a few years older than her, so I get a bit defensive when people with pitchforks and torches start screaming ""pedophilia"" and ""predators"" in this context (I know you didn't, just in general on this sub).",t3_4qnfci

Her magic button bullshit was also her admitting that it was icky because there's really not a way around that. She says it wasn't like that, except it clearly was, and Liam's reaction is the show's objectivity on the scenario. (Objectivity needed being a theme of the episode, like with the inappropriateness of Rollins treating Ali.) As a result, Aria rambles on about her yearning for a magic button and it is as pathetic as it sounds. It's her saying 'yeah, this happened to me, but I am who I am in part as a result of it so I've accepted it because I've accepted me'. Not for nothing but that's the kind of thing that survivors say when they've gotten to a certain stage of acceptance over something... and that's not really the best way to be talking about your present boyfriend? lol I think the show is actually doing a great job of dealing with Aria being more adult and now looking at her relationship with Ezra from a more adult perspective.

It'd be interesting if they showed that starting to create some doubt in Aria's mind about whether Ezra was a good person and whether she really had been hurt by him, whether it was fair what he did, and show that process. Maybe at some point she could talk to the other Liars and be like ""Guys? Was Ezra ever... predatory, do you think?"" and the Liars could be like ""Well, yeah..."" and start giving examples. Maybe someone could be like ""I'm now close to how old Ezra was when he started dating you, and if I were to even consider dating someone in *10th grade*... well, I wouldn't consider that, because they'd be a kid. You were a kid!"" and then Aria would maybe mull all of this over for a while because it's a lot to process. And at some point maybe confront Ezra. I think it'd have to be a long process because Aria's spent so long thinking she wasn't hurt, that Ezra's a good guy, etc. that there'd be so many emotions wrapped up there, especially since she still cares about Ezra.

6060,d4w6z5y,t1_d4w6frr,"Aahh well that's good. It is one of the greatest shows ever I think. So immersive and constantly has me thinking about who's AD. And again, I can see how from your perspective you're a little grossed out by Ezria in the pilot, I started watching in 2012 and thought it was a bit extreme at the time. But I see it for what it is - not a man who tried to make Aria succumb to him, but a joint effort so to speak, like they both wanted that, I didn't think it was icky in any way, it seemed completely natural onscreen at the time. Yes I can see how it makes you feel sick, but I think everyone is different. Obviously if there was a predatory man in real life targeting a teen girl then that is completely wrong. But I just think on PLL, it's one of the nicest most romantic storylines for me. I like Haleb, Spoby and Ezria equally but there was something quite magical about Ezria for me (in seasons 1 and 2). And bc season 1 was quite dark and suspenseful, I think it added to the drama. Like I'll always remember that scene where she comes in from the rain after being in the car with Ezra, and Byron talks to her and she thinks that he's found out. It was things like that, the tenseness of it all, that made season 1 for me. Well I'm glad to have made peace with an anti-Ezria, not that I've been at war with one, but I had some animosity yesterday, so it just goes to show that an anti-Ezria and a pro-Ezria can get on üôÇ",t3_4qnfci

1000 cases over 30 years is 33 a year, I wouldn't be surprised if you see figures like that in a lot of places in the country. That figure has definitely been spun to make it look worse than it is.

No one thinks this. Not even the Britain First goons. But there is always a comment like yours making sure we know that whites rape too. ",t3_84u9te
6177,dvt35er,t1_dvt1wtk,So what's up with the poor non-muslim South Asians not grooming?,t3_84u9te
6178,dvvwoth,t1_dvvobdh,"Yeah right, fucking revolting moral standards. It's exactly the logic that led to the CSE abuse carrying on for so long. Let's not convey it the the public, let's sweep it under the rug and pretend it's not happening because it might embolden the far right. A few thousand young girls being used and abused is apparently an acceptable price for maintaining a facade of a harmonious multicultural city. ",t3_84u9te
6179,dvt6pom,t1_dvt3r38,Then why the preface by them of naming these gangs with Muslim if it doesn't matter? Why are they pushing aggressive leaflets through innocent Muslim doors and no one else? Marching down streets with crosses proclaiming to be Christian whilst agitating local Muslim communities? Or why they're harassing Muslims who have nothing to do with some Muslims who gang raped a girl? This head in the sand attitude is almost as bad as the neglect these kids have endured that got them abused in the first place. There is an anti Muslim agenda.,t3_84u9te
6180,dvt3qrv,t1_dvt35er,I'm sure purely by percentages that there are some who do. You'll find them in India hindi groomers for example. Nothing to do with being hindi. There may be an argument that religious constraints make groomers if you look at the Catholic church. But then it would invalidate the purely anti-muslim agenda. I think you'll have to find better evidence tbh,t3_84u9te
6181,dvt6s5r,t1_dvt35er,But then the other logic is if it's because they are Muslim why are non Muslims forming grooming gangs with the exact same methods and aims? ,t3_84u9te
6182,dvvo83c,t1_dvt6pom,"> There is an anti Muslim agenda.

No, there is an anti-raping children agenda.  Political correctness is what caused the authorities to ignore and therefore enable this abuse for years.",t3_84u9te

6184,dvt7gwm,t1_dvt6s5r,[deleted],t3_84u9te
6185,dvvwc24,t1_dvvo83c,No there is an anti Muslim agenda. If it was anti rape there wouldn't be the harassment and hate of innocent Muslims due to the horrific actions of Muslim child groomers. We can all be on board with hating groomers but as they are Muslim it tends to leak into wider distrust of the demographic  when being a Muslim does not make someone a rapist. I hope I'm getting my point clear here. ,t3_84u9te
6186,dvt7uiw,t1_dvt7gwm,And what are the facts? You can't say that then ignore what other grooming gangs are doing and the similarities as much as you do the disparities. ,t3_84u9te

To think that they are abusing girls simply because they are Muslim is dangerous conjecture. Just to be clear. I condemn these people but I'm trying to be clear that innocent people seem to be getting attacked for their actions which isn't right. And that is down to misinformation.",t3_84u9te

By focusing on one group of paedos, you‚Äôre ignoring another... entirely. You suddenly wake up and get angry when it‚Äôs brown people doing it. 

Paedophiles are the exact same. They have the same desires, same sick morals. Pure evil, through and through yet you still separate them because of race or religion. ",t3_8y0ytf

There are child abusers, sex abusers and all sorts of perverted people in the UK in all colors and all religions. And not just in the UK but all over the world. Islam is a religion that allows pedophilia and child marriage in this current modern society. It is part of their culture in some Muslim countries and some even have inbreeding. (Pakistan for example). 

I posted this because 'grooming gang' is not a well known term in the USA. 
It doesn't 'sound' like it would be anything serious.

By the way, I'm brown myself. I'm not Muslim but Muslim is not a color or a race and they are in every country and come in every color. Islam is a religion and an ideology...not a race.

I'm not against any race but I am against Pedophilia. I also am not a fan of Islam. I consider it a backwards and a horrible religion but there are a few that are trying to reform it so I hope they succeed and take out the terrorist ideology. I'm not for violence but we have free speech to debate and discuss things in civility.",t3_8y0ytf

6201,e29ko7d,t1_e286uib,Terrorism is not the norm in Islam actually. There are literally billions of Muslims if they all wanted ‚Äúinfidels‚Äù dead we would be. Same with pedophilia.

6202,e289jmy,t1_e286uib,"You do realise that the USA is the largest provider and consumer of child pornography? We had people like Gary Glitter deliberately travelling out of the UK to rape children, and Jimmy Saville taking advantage of sick children, which the BBC allowed and chose to ignore. So even before muslims and immigrants came here, paedophilia was rife. It has ALWAYS been a problem. And by targeting one set group, we aren‚Äôt going to tackle it. 

You‚Äôve said yourself you don‚Äôt like Islam which makes sense why your post is aimed at them alone, fine go ahead. I don‚Äôt know much about any religion, but you‚Äôre going to find perverts everywhere. My own father and grandfather were.  And look for yourself, there‚Äôs child marriages going on in America as well. Young girls forced into marrying at 12 years old and have spoken out about it, and this is without any religion. Even here in the UK, marrying children was legal up until a point. 

By the way, you‚Äôll find incest in a lot of places. There‚Äôs even a subreddit on here for that. 

We live in a sick world filled with evil people. Have you ever heard of Peter Scully? He was an Australian who travelled to Philippines, where he raped and murdered children with his girlfriend, recorded it and sold it for like minded sickos on the dark web. His youngest victim wasn‚Äôt even 2 years old. There was absolutely no influence from religion here. While it can be a problem, it‚Äôs not the only one. 

So even if they were to succeed and reform islam, remove  marrying children etc. we‚Äôre still left with non muslim paedos, right?",t3_8y0ytf

6205,e29njpl,t1_e29ko7d,"How many Muslims do you think at this point right now want Westerners dead? 100. 10,000, 100,0000? How many Muslims in Europe want to make Europe a Muslim country and live under Sharia? 

Rapes are on the increase. There have people been beheaded and killed in Europe just because they were not Muslim? This is not once a year. Even the news mentions how police foils plots for attack.

Hamas, Hezbollah, Al Qaeda, Boko Haram.....are Muslim terrorist groups that exist right now. How many do you think are in these groups? How many wives support them? How many children want to die as a Martyr killing for Allah? 

Go look up statistics. I see the posts daily. I am sorry but you have your head in the sand if you don't notice it. 

I can hate Islam if I want to. It is a religion, not a people. People who don't know what they are talking about revert to cussing as if that means anything. You didn't change my mind or make me feel like I was wrong in the slightest because even today you will find examples of Islamic terrorism if you look at the news. Maybe not on CNN.

Love people, not lies. Islam is a lie. I hope they reform. It causes too much damage in the world. Women are going to prison in Iran today for not wearing a hijab or dancing in public. One woman just recently got a sentence of 20 years. Women are treated as 2nd class. Some even have to wear full coverings in public. This is oppression. Girls are getting their genitals sliced....today. This is not an old practice that was done away with, it's still going on.

I can go on and on but the best way for you to understand is to see for yourself and look into it yourself. Find out how many were killed, imprisoned and oppressed and persecuted just in the name of Islam and how many of these same people live in Western countries?  Find out for yourself.

As far as Christianity goes, I post up their pedophilia up here too. I post up pedogate links no matter what religion or color. It is happening everywhere and in every country. It is a shame when so called Christians are exposed but people ignore it more when Muslims do it and point to their 'culture'.

Instead of freaking out on small things. You should have tried to read what I said instead of blowing things out of proportion. 

Incest is not normal and is shunned in the USA but in Pakistan it is a normal every day acceptable reality.

Yep, I don't like Islam. It is a religion that is filled with problems and needs to be reformed.

Are we talking about past or current time because right now it is not legal in the USA or UK to have sex with children or pimp them out for sex.
