"I need help, I don't know what to do. It won't stop.",https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/i-need-help-i-dont-know-what-to-do-it-wont-stop_475/,"This guy that harassed me back in 2007 is harassing me again.
a LOT.
I don't understand what to do!
They backed up lots of my posts from other sites onto a Google Drive where they back up my stuff and spread it,
they upload my old vent videos onto youtube as they make fun of me in the comments.
they told me to die on twitter and linked to the google drive folder.
they linked to the google drive folder on Tumblr and keep harassing me.
on instagram they made a hate account dedicated toward me and told their followers to follow me on alt accounts and to send him screenshots of my followers so that he can message them and say bad things about me to them.
And I reported this on all of those social media sites, but none of them do anything. They say its not a violation of their policies. Even with the Google Drive folder and the YouTube videos where they uploaded a lot of my own videos that I posted on twitter and tumblr onto YouTube without my permission in it, YouTube and Google Drive did nothing when I reported them.
How can I deal with this harasser? He's also harassing my friends and followers and blaming it on me. He keeps harassing me every single day now. He told me he knows where I live and that he can call me right now and that he backed up my posts. I don't know how to get this to end! I keep ignoring and blocking and reporting him, but it won't stop."
Instagram anonymous messages,https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/instagram-anonymous-messages_454/,"Hi there,

After I started my business and now they attacking my business people with who I work and ppl who I know. They keep sending anonymous messages to everyone in Instagram non stop. It’s hurts so bad, I feel like they want me to die. My business brings me good money, but I see a lots of ppl doesn’t want to talk to me anymore. I’m crying every single day and drinking alcohol."
Doxing,https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/doxing_473/,"Hi, I was recently doxed by a few people who keyword searched my Twitter and found my use of unsavory language when I was 15. I'm now in my mid-20s. Though I did not use those words with malicious intent, I of course never use them now because I recognize they can be hurtful. These people sent the tweets to my graduate school with the hope that they would rescind my admission. While the school ultimately ruled in my favor, I am now fearful of ever returning to the internet. I have a decent internet following, and I want to do what's right. I want to help promote diversity and inclusion. But now I am afraid to ever go back. I feel like they made me believe something about myself that wasn't true. Can't people change? Will I ever be able to exist in this world without being afraid that people are after me for my past mistakes?"
I feel hopeless right now,https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/i-feel-hopeless-right-now_474/,"I've had a group of ppl harassing me for over a year now - I took a stand against a private Facebook page ridiculing local addicts by name, using their pictures with the caption ""Meth or Not"" & just being really cruel. I don't regret standing up for other ppl but I can't have a social media account without insults & innuendos, suggestions that they have videos/pictures of me engaging in sexual acts with partners i had no idea were filming me (if they were). Its completely destroyed my trust in anyone to the point where I have isolated myself from any constant beyond my immediate family. After a couple of relationships that came up out of the blue ended up being recruits of theirs, sent for the soul purpose of getting close to me - to then reveal themselves as yet another tormentor - Im at a loss. I've had my car vandalized but now because I was involved with someone with bad intentions who had access to my devices, there seems to be software running on my phone that affords some level of monitoring/spying & I really just need help. I feel like I sound crazy & I also feel like that's something else that was counted on. Can anyone offer help/resources for me? Thank you in advance."

Internet use during lockdown - are you getting the best out of it?,https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/internet-use-during-lockdown-are-you-getting-the-best-out-of-it_459/,"Hi everyone! My first post on the forum, so I thought I would make it an interesting one.
As most of us are probably under some sort of 'lockdown' during the Covid pandemic, I wanted to ask how folks are using the internet and if it is helping you or making things worse?
For me, i'm keeping an eye on the news but not allowing myself to be led too far down extreme opinion routes - such as 'it's 5G's fault' or 'It's being used as a weapon', 'the Chinese did it on purpose' etc etc.
I'm also catching up with friends and family more online and i'm trying to use the internet to connect in a positive way with people. I think it is important to do this. How about you?"
Coping with Cyberbullying,https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/coping-with-cyberbullying_457/,"Hi.
This is my first post on this community so I wanted to also take it as a chance to introduce myself.
I am a 14 year old and I am a female. I have autism and anxiety. I have been a victim of cyberbullying, physical bullying and verbal bullying at school for nearly 3 years. :(
I don't know how to cope with all of the cyberbullying. I have tried deleting the group chat but the thoughts of it are whirring through my head making me feel really sad, anxious, hated and worthless.
Sorry for bothering you. Nice to meet you all."

Risks to kids online during the coronavirus lockdown.,https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/risks-to-kids-online-during-the-coronavirus-lockdown_456/,"I've been reading a lot about the increased risk to kids spending more time online during the 'lockdown' including cyberbullying, hate campaigns, grooming, fraud or phishing scams and also mis-information about the coronavirus such as drinking soap and outlandish conspiracy theories.

At School,https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/at-school_436/,"Since my sophomore year in high school, I have been targeted by the same girl, no matter where I am at football games, the hallways, at the mall shopping, and now it has escalated to online. She graduated last year, meaning I am a senior. I wanted this year to be amazing: I finally pulled myself out of a dark hole, and I have finally started to accept myself for my flaws. But yesterday, she came back from college with a vengeance. I was at our schools football game and she approached me, yelling derogatory terms at me, ones that should never be used against any female at any age. My friends stood up for me, and I am eternally greatful. But she did it again. Twice in the same night. When she was finally out of sight, I ran to the bathroom and started sobbing. My friends helped me wipe my tears and we went to Waffle House and had a blast. I woke up at 6:00 this morning to multiple messages from my friends, sending me a screenshot of what she posted on her Instagram. It claimed that she did say those things to me, and she was proud of it because it made me cry. She claimed that she told one of my teachers and he agreed with her (that I was a s*** and a crybaby). She did not use my name, but she said that people who want to know who the girl is(me) can dm her for my name and more of the story. I just wanted this to be a good year, and I don't know what to do.
Should I go to administration? Should I involve the teacher that supposedly agree with her? I have witnesses from multiple incidences that can back me up even in court according to my state's anti-bullying laws. My parents want to take this to court, and I just want a non-stressful senior year."
Playground woes,https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/playground-woes_453/,"Hello everyone! First time poster alert :-). I'm after some advice please.....
As a lot of parents if school kids will know, parents these days set up parent groups on things like WhatsApp, to make things like school events,parties, remembering homework etc etc much easier.
Well, yesterday morning I asked in our private group (no one is excluded - we are all in there) l, very simply what time all their kids went to bed. Nothing more nothing less.
Throughout the day we all had a very nice chat on there swapping answers etc and everything was fine as it always is.
At school pick up time,I'm then shown(by a kind mum) a screenshot of a PUBLIC facebook post which shows my private WhatsApp mmessage and a vile reply telling me I'm a useless parent,I should be sterslised and I should smother my kids in their sleep to put them out of their misery.
I'm absolutely gutted tbh.
It's been done by one if the school dads who I speak to daily and thought we were friends.
His vile facebook post shows my initials and surname and everything.
I need advice on what to do please.
Part of me wants to ignore out of self preservation but part of me wants to ask him how the hell he could be so mean.
In this day and age I also want to report him.
Its making ne feel so rubbish :-("

I don't know what to do anymore,https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/i-dont-know-what-to-do-anymore_445/,"So I fell out with someone who knows where I live. They have a website and a Youtube channel that they now use for spreading misinformation, rumors and lies about me and people I both know and don't know. She accuses me of so many things that are not true, it's staggering how misinformed she is. I've reached out online and irl but because we both are in a different country to one another, nobody knows what to do. I tried to ignore it but they keep showing up wherever I go online somehow. I am tired of it but they won't stop."
Sent a nude to a girl who asked me then threatened they was going to find me and arrest me,https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/sent-a-nude-to-a-girl-who-asked-me-then-threatened-they-was-going-to-find-me-and-arrest-me_446/,So I remember correctly I was 17 at the time and I was talking to this girls profile on Kik and they eventually asked me to send over an explicit picture of myself and stupidly I agreed. I can't remember how old the profile of the girl was but I'm starting to think this wasn't a real girl as when I sent it they then said they was going to find me and arrest me. I was so scared by this threat I deleted the app straight away of my phone and haven't been back on since. I'm 23 years old now and haven't heard anything from the police either. I'm worried if this was a undercover police officer or someone trying to scam me or blackmail me or something like that. Hope anyone can help me it will be much appreciated I'm really scared and don't want to go to prison
Help with Bullying,https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/help-with-bullying_448/,"My daughter is being bullied at school. This weekend 6 girls sent her a picture...they were all sticking up their middle fingers and it read “when the whole squad hates the same bitch”.
The person who took the picture (without the title of course) was a mother of one of the girls. Since she is an adult helping to bully a 12 year old girl is there anything legally I can do?"
My cyberbullying experience,https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/my-cyberbullying-experience_443/,"Hi, my online name is Charlie or Nat, I don't like giving out my personal name on stuff
I'm going to tell you my experiences on a website called Quotev. It's a quiz website and were you can also make fanfiction and make friends. But when I joined, it was all but toxity.
Me and my online friends that I met on there have to keep our 'mouths' closed. Because we can't say anything that'll possibly offend anyone. And I don't mean offend like racial stuff. But I met if you dare accidentally call someone a dude when they are a girl and we had no clue. We then get attacked, like we get these things called call-out journals. The journals are made to get the bad people off, such as people that support something that is illegal. But the journals can be overused
I've made my mistakes on this website, some I didn't know the full story or I didn't know the full topic. I've gotten call outs all the time. The people that make the call out journals use screenshots, within the screenshot, it's just them over reacting or they took it the completely the wrong way. There has actually been one accusing thing that drove me up the wall.
What happened in the call-outs that weren't necessary, was that the mean stuff the people would say, and all the sexual comments. Like we're talking about some disgusting stuff. And I am not telling you guys because you shouldn't see nor hear it.
There is also people that have multiple accounts, they use to gather information. Like they can act like they're on your side, but in reality they're not. I know that is bullying right there, but when I try to tell the people, they say it's all right. So blocking will not work.
I have some mental and health issues, I am not your typical late teenager. I have autism and such and when I say that, they say I'm lying, they say that they are autistic and they are better than me.
There is also the way your profile has to look. It has to be astethic and stuff. And if you don't want your profile to look bland, well good luck on the website.
Note: There is definitely more stories about this website, but I just want to put this out there. I made it very bland because the examples that I would've used would be disgusting, offensive, and rude. And it's NOT 'You are stupid' it's worse.
Thank you for reading my story, and hopefully the cyberbullying will stop all together, on not just the website but with ALL websites. Thanks again."
Tips on how to forgive,https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/tips-on-how-to-forgive_439/,"I was bullied within the club sport I did for 5 years straight. It’s been about a year now since I’ve quit and have tried to move on. I can’t find peace and I don’t know how to forgive these people who caused me pain. I still see these people in public, and I have panicked responses. I know healing can take a while, but a few tips on how to move on would be nice."
Bullying,https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/bullying_442/,I have recently moved to a new area about a year ago. And this year I have had so many problems with the school from cussing my child out to making other kids bully her. I have call all the way up to the state board and nothing is being dune except them being meaner to her. I need advice on who I can speak to.
Younow an unsafe place for people with special needs/autism,https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/younow-an-unsafe-place-for-people-with-special-needsautism_440/,"I'd like to tell ya'll about my unfortunate time on the broadcasting site YouNow I have used that site since late 2014 it was fun at for a while, over the next 2 years I made lots of friends, then starting in 2017 things changed and the drama started more and more broadcasters started seeing their fans as a form of income from tips and less human, a long since gone broadcaster I was friends with all of a sudden turned on me because I didn't have the money to tip, when I told her I was on disability she turned around and did everything but cuss me out telling me a real fan would have a real job and money to tip. So I got mad, and instead of flipping out, I told her about my aspurgers and depression she turned around and blocked me from her broadcast saying she didn't need people like me in her broadcast, she only wanted people smart enough to keep up. so because I was very hurt and really only had one friend from the site I could talk to I left, leaving behind a lot of people I felt safe with. For about 5 months I stayed off the site floating from chat site to chat site just to have someone to talk to, I missed my connections with some of the broadcasters from younow so I made a new account, I was welcomed back better than I could have hoped for, so for a while I felt safe again, that was up until April 2019, Autism awareness/mental health became topic, which at first I thought was a good idea a topic I could guest with someone and tell my story, man was I wrong, only a very few broadcasters talked on the subject, and a lot of the ones who didn't said things like ""not my problem"" ""people are just begging for attention and trying to get me to feel sorry for them"" many broadcasters made fun of people with ptsd by repeating may times during a broadcast ""oh I can't say that I might trigger someone"" or when they were guesting with someone else or in a another broadcast they would repeat ""you can't do that or you can't say that I might get triggered"" this went on for a couple of months then people started leaving for other sites, which wrong or right I liked because I could feel safer and more welcome with the ones I watched. I was wrong again a lot of broadcaster treated me kindly and with respect but one broadcaster took it upon himself to start blocking autistic people, he did this to many of them, he made a blanket statement where he claimed because they couldn't always understand what he was talking about that all we ever were was a distraction to his broadcast. I tried to let my feelings go because I had other friends on the site, when I was calm about the statements that were made I went back to his broadcast to my surprise less than a week ago he replayed a clip I didn't know about on his broadcast in said clip he was talking to another broadcaster where he told her special needs people are just a disruption to YouNow and if he could he'd get them off the platform because the site had no need for them. when I heard that I cried because this broadcaster I felt safe watching felt so harshly about special needs people. So I left again, on the urging of a very close friend who is a broadcaster that I knew and talked to off site I made a new account with a new name she wanted me in her broadcast because she told me I always made her feel special and could help keep drama out of her broadcasts, I did, with this new account I was hidden and safe, I've been sticking to mainly to her broadcasts.when she wasn't on I would stop into broadcasts of someone of the ones I once watched. one of my friends is also autistic and left the same time I did but never made a new account. I was happy just sitting back watching the few I did while not being noticed, come to find out tonight while I was in a broadcast of one that I felt closest to I heard her and her guest she was streaming with making fun of the reason I left, I guess she thought another screen name was me because she turned around and said I know who you are and I know why you left, you couldn't handle the site, and that if I knew I was part of the problem I should have left along time ago, tonight I also found out the very broadcaster that made statements about special needs people told his viewers that autistic people trigger him and that he doesn't need them in his stream and had block a lot of people. To sum this up the best I can I feel that if you have any type of disability YouNow is a very toxic environment, they will find any way to make you feel different, in the way and a joke, I've tried reporting many broadcasters for the way they treat people to the mods only to get an email back saying that YouNow sees no problem with what the broadcasters are saying, they have even gone as far as to ban my account for three days for reporting a Partnered broadcasters (one who gets a paycheck and splits the profits from tips with the site) Younow has always treated the ones who bring in the money like they can do no wrong. The site in the past few months has become more and more about broadcasters taking shots at a certain number of tips, females who make their broadcast as sexually suggestive as they can with in the rules which are never enforced when its a partnered broadcaster , adult males watching and guesting young children while making lewd comments. over all this should be an 18+ site. I strongly suggest parents keep their children off the site not only for their personal safety (some how people can get numbers and addresses of users and leak them to people) but for their mental health keeping them from seeing just how cruel the world can be at such a young age.....I'm not the best of writers but if you made it this far thank you P.S. I still keep to the broadcast of the one friend who made me feel the safest and most loved in her own special way, for all she's been through with me I feel the least I can is be there for her like she is for me and to say thank you"
Facebook Moderators suffering from stress?,https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/facebook-moderators-suffering-from-stress_437/,Just read some reports about out-sourced moderator teams who are suffering from PTSD like symptoms because of the images they are employed to block or take down. I am stunned that humans are doing this because you would need millions of people to do this effectively. Even more stunned that they have not used their incredible resources to engineer AI or smart tech to address this.

Fortnight is about as harmful as Sponge Bob IMO. Are we going to start banning TV shows, films, art, or music that someone thinks is 'harmful'?

need advice with serious cyberbullying,https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/need-advice-with-serious-cyberbullying_411/,"hi everyone,
a few months back i angered someone by making a joke in the comments of a youtube video. the person responded with threats but i ignored them at the time (my name doesn't show on my account). a few weeks later however, troll accounts with strange names like rubber mark and canard wc started to join every discord i participe in (its a chat for gamers) and after insulting me for a while they demanded that i pay them bitcoin for offending their made-up 'god'. then things started escalating real bad: first they dumped my private details online and hacked some of my accounts, then i started getting silent night calls and now i even received a letter calling me 'their slave' (with my face on it) at my home.
i googled the name of their club (jlfksjlfl) and found multiple occurrences of defaced accounts and even one mention of a teen that committed suicide.
i'm thinking of going to the police but i don't have any information at all on these guys so they probably wont do anything. paying is another option but even if i gathered the money what guarantee do i have that they won't ask for more?
if anyone has been in a similar situation i'd like to hear ur advice thanks"
Bullying,https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/bullying_434/,"Bullying is an ongoing problem within the world where others physically, mentally, or socially harm someone for numerous reasons; which may include: their appearance, their way of acting, even their beliefs. With a percentage of 41.7% of students getting bullied in a classroom, and 33.6% of students getting bullied in the hallway, there are many reasons why there should be more protection for students while they're in school. One being, that by having more protection for students in school, it ensures that each student is safe and feel comfortable while they are learning, and have a more efficient day whilst being in class. They wouldn't have to be afraid of what may happen to them during school, and they it would positively affect their physical and mental behavior, as well. Adding on to this, if there were more protection, more students will want to come to school with a peaceful set of mind, knowing they will always be safe, and experiencing many new things while gaining their education. Bullying isn't different than cyber bullying, either. While it is different in a way where there isn't any physical interactions between the people, there still are mental and social bullying. Cyber bullying is when people bully someone else online, and excluding them from conversations, saying hurtful things to them, etc. Many people who undergo bullying and/or cyber bullying may have headaches, stomachaches, stress, depression, and can even become suicidal. If schools added more protection for students, they may also notice the students who use social media and are either being cyber bullied, or are the cyber bully them-self, and do something about it and more students will be safe while being on the internet as well."

Facebook don't have any cyberbullying support,https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/facebook-dont-have-any-cyberbullying-support_174/,"Facebook still aren't offering its users support if they are affected by cyberbullying and abuse. Why do you think this is? Facebook seems to be where most of the bullying is happening, surely they have a responsibility to provide support to the victims? They have a few weird organisations they work with but these seem to be more PR type partnerships with no real work being done."
I'm back + joined many social medias,https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/im-back-joined-many-social-medias_429/,"I haven't been in a long while here on this site, and I love some new features such as the Cybersmile assistant. As an update I have started university now, accounting and finance major, and most of the people I am surrounded with are shy and quiet people, but yet I trust no one. It's not that they are bad, but I'm not connected with them yet. And yes, there are a few bullies among them but now I ignore them.
I have changed my mindset, all thanks to following some people like Gary Vaynerchuk (check Curse free Garyvee Youtube channel) who often speaks about kindness and what to do in life in general, Justin Dewit who makes fascinating science related videos, BTS - a worldwide known Korean boy band where they sing about social problems and mental health issues + they even have a campaign called ""Love myself"" dedicated to their cause, and many more people who deserve to be called influencers instead of these fitness/model people who do the opposite.
I also expanded social medias, except Facebook and Instagram, I now use Twitter, LinkedIn, Snapchat. Google+ shut down unfortuneately, but I plan on making a blog dedicated to my creative content like comics. Haven't encountered any bullying yet on any of them, since I am strict on who gets in and out in my contact list.
And one big lesson I learned is: To love yourself :)"
I'm (still) a bully,https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/im-still-a-bully_408/,"These days I'm in such a bad mood that sometimes I see myself get out of me and be a totally different person. It's still there! The bullying habit! I can't believe I did it again but I did.
It wasn't the first time tho. I've called people that offensive word even though intention was not bad, but still offends. I wanna share body positivity but in fact that is offensive to do so.
I've had this nice friend of mine who was my inspiration on instagram, and he was always there for me in bad times. But what I did today to him was unforgivable... I wanted to tell him how attractive he is, but somehow I rushed and without thinking I offended on his looks (not saying). I didn't mean to say it in an offensive way, but it did hurt him and it was my fault.
I've called many people that word and I kinda feel worse that I haven't let go my bad habit of bullying. I need to train myself to stop, but I can't help it. I'm not always sad, so that's why most of time my thoughts are clear, but when I'm sad no.
Now all of his friends bully me for that and I understand. Help me find apps, resources or anything to stop myself. I installed rethink keyboard, but there should be more"

Cyber bullying game,https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/cyber-bullying-game_419/,"I'm thinking of developing a game where you go through scenarios and you have to make choices about whether you're going to join in the bullying, not do anything, or stand up.

What boosts your self esteem and self worth?,https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/what-boosts-your-self-esteem-and-self-worth_281/,"AS we know many trolls and cyberbullies have a lot of issues with their self esteem and self worth. Hurting others is a way for them to feel empowered when they feel dis empowered. But many victims also struggle with self esteem and self worth, and when we are bullied that can erode our self worth even further.
So I thought I would start a thread where we celebrate what increases our self esteem and a healthy view of self. Perhaps someone reading this may just need that little reminder that they are WORTHY and that they are not defined by those that want to bring them down. Bullies too.
So let's get started! Share below what helps remind you of your worth! It's not just validating your talents but you as person. You are worthy despite things that you are good at. So really dig deep if you can!
I'll go first. What really reminds me of my self worth is being reminded that it's okay when I make a mistake. That I am human and fallible and I am accepted and appreciated regardless. That hasn't always been easy for me. It was always drummed into me that one is either good or bad with no middle ground to be human. So I really appreciate the reminder that I am human and will make mistakes and that's okay.
How about you?"
Self Esteem - Basics,https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/self-esteem-basics_417/,"What Is Self-Esteem?
Possessing little self-regard can lead people to become depressed, to fall short of their potential, or to tolerate abusive situations and relationships. Too much self-love, on the other hand, results in an off-putting sense of entitlement and an inability to learn from failures. It can also be a sign of clinical narcissism, in which individuals may behave in a self-centered, arrogant, and manipulative manner. Perhaps no other self-help topic has spawned so much advice and so many (often conflicting) theories.
Self-esteem can influence in our lives in a myriad of ways, from academic and professional success to relationships and mental health. Self-esteem is not an immutable characteristic; successes or setbacks, both personal and professional, can fuel fluctuations in our feelings of self-worth.
Each individual’s experience is different, but this psychological resource seems to rise and fall in systematic ways across the lifespan. Research suggests that self-esteem grows, by varying degrees, until age 60, when it remains steady before beginning to decline in old age. (Source: Psychology Today UK)"

Unable to cope with not only the continuous tirades of abuse and exposure to innocence stealing material that's present on Facebook but also unable to cope with the feeling of complete and utter powerlessness when trying to get Facebook to deal with incidents of abuse.

Dreams-
1) My dream/hope is to get reasonable grades in all my AS exams hopefully all C's/D's at least and a Distinction in production.
2) Also I hope to start training for the half marathon by the 1st June and start running further distances (2 miles)
3) To start more volunteering with young people and children ready for university, and have done at least 25 hours by the end of june.

Should The Schools Monitor The Students Computer Usage More Closely,https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/should-the-schools-monitor-the-students-computer-usage-more-closely_35/,From what I saw when I was in school when we went to computer lab the people that sat near me I always caught them on facebook when they were done with their work. Or for those that didn't care about their school work they were on facebook anyways.

hi:-),https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/hi_16/,"Hi!!
During the ages of 11-14 I was being bullied online. Mostly on MSN. Yes I know... Its very old, but it did use to be popular lol:).. Anyway, there was two people, he use to send me nasty messages, call me names, and make me feel very vunrable. I never told anyone at first, I thought it was my fault, like I caused it. Looking back now I know I didn't. Due to me not telling anyone, it was making my school life, and home very difficult. I got angry, kicked off at people, skipped so many classes. Thinking I wasn't 'normal'. My friend realised something wasn't right , I shown her some of the messages I was getting. My friend got me too speak to my geography teacher. I was terrified. In the end it got sorted , I had so much support from school and other agencies. It took me a while to get my trust in people back and to get myself back on my feet. I got here in the end. Some of you may remember the sites BB and MF, they did a lot to help me.
II'm very thankful for this new site. Love it already. #posotivity as cybersmile would say. . <3

Will cyberbullying get worse in the future?,https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/will-cyberbullying-get-worse-in-the-future_134/,I wonder if cyberbullying is going to get worse in the future? I mean people are using the Internet and social media younger and younger so it would make sense that the problem is going to get worse. What do you think?
Gaming tournament,https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/gaming-tournament_121/,"Today I saw an announcement about a gaming tournament happening in my town. The tournament is about an action game, where participants have to create a team from 5 players. I really want to take part in that tournament, but there are a little problems.
The game. I haven't played it for 5 years (since I changed my PC operative system to Windows7). I have forgotten few things like weapon shortcuts and places. That isn't very big problem as there I have a friend who can help me remind the game.
The other problem is- my town seems hasn't got any gamer girls. And the worst is that there's no girl that plays the action game. So I would feel uncomfortable to be the only girl there.
But in the other side I like the main price. Entry fee isn't very expensive too.
Should I join the tournament?"
Should we even have social media,https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/should-we-even-have-social-media_131/,what i am saying should we have any games or social media taht would talk to another person from another computer. as it causes problems right now
Chatroulette Blackmail,https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/chatroulette-blackmail_128/,I've heard some disturbing stories of people being blackmailed into sexual activity or into paying money on Chatroulette.

Realmente apoyo que este tema sea conocido por todos! Y me alegra que esta fundacion se encargue de ayudar a tantas personas!!
Help! Two of my friends misunderstood about cyberbullying issue I told them.,https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/help-two-of-my-friends-misunderstood-about-cyberbullying-issue-i-told-them_122/,"It all happened after midnight and so on. The time was 3:00 am. Many scientists know that this time the brain can't control things, especially thoughts when it comes to saying anything.
I was texting a friend on phone. It was time for bed and I told him I was going offline. But he didn't let me, by saying that he had something ""important"" to say. We started an arguement, because he was saying that he wanted to send hurtful messages to my best friend. I told him not to do it, and he kept saying some of hurtful messages he wanted to say at my best friend. This went so long (it was late too). I really couldn't control things I said in that moment, and I started ""hurting"" him by calling him with swear words. And I told him that it was cyberbullying. He asked me what was that, I told him when you say bad things to a friend on messages. Then he asked ""like what?"". At that moment I really shouldn't have told him this thing. I told him something bad about his girlfriend, like we are fighting on internet. Then when I got less angry, I saw everything that I did. I told him not to tell his girlfriend about it, because it was late, my mind wasn't clear. He replied only that he will see about that.
Few days later, the same friend told me to see what happened on a group conversation. It was on the group where my classmates talk to each other. I saw that someone there ruined the conversation by saying bad words. My friend said "" maybe you should cyberbully him"".
This is very bad. Now he thinks cyberbullying is fun.
Things went worse when his girlfriend, which is one of my closest friends, told me that she saw all the messages. She was really mad at me, but because she was my close friend, she just warned me not to talk to his boyfriend ever again. I told her that I won't.
Then few months later. He messaged me again. I told him to delete all messages and never talk to me again. He replied that he won't and he laughed.
Another day. His girlfriend got very mad. I really shouldn't believed him. I told her that I didn't try to do anything bad, but unfortunately she started to send me hurtful messages like ""you stupid idiot"", ""go fall from your balcony and die"". So she thought cyberbullying is just a joke too. The messages didn't hurt me at all, I just hated the fact I made an enemy, from a big misunderstanding. I told her I was sorry to do it again, because he messaged me first. Then she told me it was her idea. I promised I will never ever text message with him. But she said that she will let me text with him only when she will take out the thing I told him from her mind. I asked her if she was angry with me, she said no.
Now the girl has lost faith on me. And the guy isn't a bad person, only that he doesn't know what is cyberbullying. They both think that it's a joke, so how to convince them what really is cyberbullying?"

It's often for me to come across a post where someone is being called names ect, and the so
cial media is doing nothing about it.
I feel as if cyber bullying isn't mentioned enough these days. Especially in Schools. I want a way of promoting positive things over the Internet, aimed directly at the victims...but social media's still don't have something like this.
What do you think about social media's and their bullying situations? Do you think it's mentioned enough?"
When does cyberbullying become harassment?,https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/when-does-cyberbullying-become-harassment_113/,It's my understanding that one of the laws that protect us from being abused online is harassment laws. I wondered when does online abuse become harassment and how bad does it need to be before we can get the Police involved?
New Cybersmile Ambassadors,https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/new-cybersmile-ambassadors_84/,"It's amazing that Fifth Harmony and Richard Armitage have both been announced as official Cybersmile Ambassadors and have joined the Cybersmile movement for positivity online!

Cyberbullying affects males too,https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/cyberbullying-affects-males-too_112/,I think it's important to recognise that cyberbullying/online bullying affects boys and men just as badly as it does girls and women. I know statistics shows that girls are a little bit more likely to be affected but I still think it's important that we keep the conversation alive around the problems males face online because otherwise men/boys will start becoming uncomfortable talking about their problems.

If you could convey one positive message to a bully what would it be?,https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/if-you-could-convey-one-positive-message-to-a-bully-what-would-it-be_96/,"Sometimes we may encounter online bullying that is very hard to shut off from. It could be that it's being perpetrated by someone from our school or workplace or someone who is part of an online community we are active in.
If you HAD to respond, what is one positive and potential helpful thing you could say to them?
Now, if you can't or choose not to respond (sometimes that is better) What positive message would you have liked to convey to them? Sometimes writing it down in a journal or as a letter ( that is never sent) can help with the anger and pain we feel after experiencing bullying. I know that has worked for me. Changing a negative experience into a positive, means that we have taken the power back from the person who is trying to bring us down.
It's pretty empowering!
What would you say to them if you could?"

Moreover, if you have never experienced cyberbullying, how have you used your favorite social media that may have helped reduce/eliminate the threat of trolls and bullying?"
"Dear parents of gamers, part 1 league of legends.",https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/dear-parents-of-gamers-part-1-league-of-legends_85/,"So I know a lot of parents are unsure about certain games and I've seen several topics about unsure parents asking Cybersmile for advice on the games their children play; to be honest all games can be more 'dangerous' than others and there is no way to round up all games into one sentence that comforts parents on the games their children play. I'm going to be listing all of the games that I have experience on as a gamer (that I can, I'm only human) to give some as truthful as possible advice on the ones I have played, lets get started.
-League of legends, AKA: LOL
League of legends by far is the game I play the most and the one I enjoy the most, unfortunately it is not the friendliest and usually has people around the age of 12 and up on it. The community is not anywhere close to friendly and has a very poor way of dealing with internet trolls on their end. But they do however provides some tools that can help extremely, most commonly being the mute button allowing you to mute any offensive player that may be hindering your gaming experience there is the option to switch chat off entirely too. The best solution for this game is to keep an eye on your child who plays this but make sure (s)he is comfortable in the current environment they are playing in (try not to crack down too hard on this because nobody likes people breathing over your shoulder :p)
some things that parents should know about league:
The game is not pauseable.
Leaving the game will result in a form of punishment upon the player.
An average game of league takes anywhere from 20 min to 40 min.
and finally the game can suck up your savings account faster than a hoover sucks up dust if you let it.
I'll be posting about Minecraft next, Until then stay safe gamers ^_^."
Anonymity on the internet,https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/anonymity-on-the-internet_90/,The right/choice of anonymity online is not only a very disputed subject but also hugely important too. Freedom of speech is one of the most important aspects of modern life but where does it stop? Where is the line between freedom of speech and abuse? Will people abusing our freedom of speech ultimately cost us the right to anonymity online?
Tattoos,https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/tattoos_73/,"As i have 4 tattoo's myself i wondered what others thoughts are on tattoos and whether they should be accepted in society as some professions still do not like them.

Some are in the schools, some are offered in the work place. Many target in person bullying as well as cyberbullying. Have you been involved in a anti bullying program at your school or workplace? Even if it was just a one time discussion, how did you find it? What specifically did you take away from it or what didn't you like about it?
If you could put together your own anti cyberbullying program at your school or even amongst just your friends, what would you discuss or suggests to help them cope with cyberbullying?"
Life without the internet,https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/life-without-the-internet_69/,When was the last time anybody had a full 24 hours without access to the internet whatsoever?

Cyberbullying alert on MovieStarPlanet- a MMO game for all ages,https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/cyberbullying-alert-on-moviestarplanet-a-mmo-game-for-all-ages_101/,"I have played this game for a long time, since it first got launched. At first it didn't have safe chat, and there was a little content that wasn't for children. But in meanwhile, they payed attention to safety too.
And these days I have seen many people quit this game because they have been cyberbullied. Mostly teens were them that were bullied. The reason: because of jealousy. In game there are players that pay for enjoying more benefits. They are also more famous (I mean in-game), and other players often add them as friends and some even use them for gifts and greets. The thing I want to say is that this category of players is more likely to experience bullying. The team of safety on the game doesn't do anything for it. I have seen some messages from those bullies, and they were hurtful.
I would like if cybersmile could do something in that game to decrease this thing happening, like adding a video or something to tell players of that game how worse is cyberbullying."
Should I know my teenage daughters social media passwords?,https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/should-i-know-my-teenage-daughters-social-media-passwords_63/,"I've read on various websites that parents should make sure that they know their teenagers passwords to their social media accounts such as Facebook, Twitter and Ask.fm. I've got a couple of problems with this, firstly it feels as though I'm distrusting of my teenage children and not respecting their privacy and secondly I think that if they have anything to hide surely they will just set up another account that I don't know about? I'd like to hear from everybody so I can hear varying opinions if possible."

""You will die tomorrow if you don't read this, share this text on 10 different pages and you'll be alive."" or ""you won't have luck for 100 years if you don't share this textwith 10 friends"" and same. Don't believe these things, because they are rumours. This is called ""Peer pressure"", and as you've heard, this is also one of the reasons that awakes cyberbullying issues. You have to avoid these messages or comments.
The worst part of "" peer pressure "" is that you never know who started this first. This kind of bullying is spread often on famous sites (especially Facebook or YouTube), but sometimes you can get these messages from a friend that believed the rumor.
Social sites must work to stop ""peer pressure"", and everyone has to avoid these kinds of comments and messages."

It is easy for someone to hit back and hurt someone using the internet which makes this such a big problem so how can we help them? Treating kids who cyber-bully as criminals is not the answer."
Need some advice again (and thank you!),https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/need-some-advice-again-and-thank-you_81/,"Hey everyone!
First of all, I wanted to thank everyone that wished me well and offered support whilst I was in hospital. At a time where I felt, and still feel, very alone; you were all there for me, and I can't stress enough just how important your support was to me. I'm out of hospital now too, thankfully!
I do sort of need some advice though, remember how I said a few weeks ago that I've had some trouble with bullying at college? Well although they aren't calling me names and taking the mick as much, they're all totally excluding me. I spend my time at college, sat alone in class, alone at break and lunch and I just can't help feeling this is my fault. I can't understand why I'm being blanked all of the time, I try so, so hard to act positive and smile and it seems totally pointless. I wish I had someone I could really, really be honest with some, tell them what's really going on in my head, but I'm not sure I can now. No one at college seems to care anymore, it's like they're bored of the fact I do have medical conditions and suffer with my mental health. It seems like it's all old news, boring and Im just a 'drama queen' as I keep being told.
I don't know what to do, I'm sort of scared to speak to anyone accept you guys here, and I don't know what to do really.... If I'm honest I'm scared about how things are going, how my leg keeps getting worse and with that people only block me out more. I get in trouble for being behind on work, bearing in mind I spent however long in hospital, then I've been trying to recover at home. I even went into college yesterday knowing it would make my conditions worse, because I do want to succeed and get better, but no one seems believe that. Even my mum thinks I'm just being lazy....
Sorry I've rambled, this is just the only place I feel safe to say anything.
Thank you again everyone, hope you are all well and are doing okay. Always people around if not :)

Are you or fear that you could be a cyberbully?,https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/are-you-or-fear-that-you-could-be-a-cyberbully_179/,"Have you ever wondered if your behaviour online has made you into a cyberbully? Sometimes we can get caught up in our emotions and either mirror a cyberbullies behaviour back at them or for many other reasons we've just started attacking people online.
Sometimes this kind of behaviour is down to the fact we feel angry, lonely and disempowered. We hurt others weaker then us to somehow regain that lost ""power.""
Have you been one of those people and if so, how did you deal with it? Perhaps it's a behaviour you grew out of or wanted to change. But perhaps this is something you aren't sure how to change but would like to.
What has been your experience with the above?"

I'm mum to a teenaged daughter.
I'm very actively underway in cyber space. To me it's important to be well informed about what's going on in our world. And social media has become part of it. I feel I should know at least the basics about that, to be a reliable adviser for my daughter. But I know very few other people of my generation, who think similarly. Much more often I hear, that people of the parent generation are not part of the cyber world and can advise their children only to be careful.
How do you other parents here think about it! Do you feel as informed, as your children are?"
What type of cyberbullying worries you the most?,https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/what-type-of-cyberbullying-worries-you-the-most_173/,"As we all know, there is more than one way to bully someone through the use of the internet and smart devices.

Sexting and Cyberbullying what are your thoughts?,https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/sexting-and-cyberbullying-what-are-your-thoughts_177/,"As I am sure we have all seen in the news and online, sexting is on the rise among young people. A recent qualitative study done by the NSPCC found the following:
-The primary technology-related threat comes from peers, not 'stranger danger'
-sexting is often coercive
-girls are the most adversely affected
-technology amplifies the problem by facilitating the objectification of girls
-sexting reveals wider sexual pressures
-ever younger children are affected
-sexting practices are culturally specific
-more support and resources are vital to redress the gendered sexual pressures on young people.
PARENTS: What have you found difficult about sexting? Have you spoken to your children about it and if so how did it go?
YOUTH: Have you experienced sexting and cyberbulling or know someone who has? What do you think has worked to address or highlight the issue, be it your school or community organization?
If you feel more needs to be done, what would you like to see happen in your schools or home to better equip you and your friends with the right tools when dealing with sexting?

I realised that there must be thousands of young people who are armed with their own ways of coping and I think it would be great if we could share them here. If you have any tips or ways that have worked for you please let us know. Thanks :))"

Finally got my motorbike back! :'),https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/finally-got-my-motorbike-back_156/,"Ok ok ok, I am so happy to finally say, I have got my motorbike back from the mechanic! Although I still haven't recovered from my accident I am fit enough to ride again. No more being stuck in my stupid little village in the middle of nowhere! XD I have never, ever taxed and insured anything so quickly! I also love the DVLA (for now anyway!) because they've said I don't need a VIC check which got me back on the road a week or two sooner! Let's hope they're system isn't wrong or Imma soo get pulled by the police o.O I literally cannot express how happy I am to have my bike back, and with that, my freedom.
I would like to take the time though just to say, please please watch out for bikers (not that I don't trust you all) :P But everyone makes mistakes when they are in a rush or aren't concentrating. The only reason I was involved in an accident is because one driver failed to look before pulling out onto a main road. No idea how she missed my hi-vis jacket; I look like a poxy glow stick riding down the road haha! It's just important to bear in mind that most riders involved in accidents are not as lucky as I was. I escaped with my life, and somehow (don't know how) escaped serious injury too! I must have a guardian angel somewhere... Please Think Biker :)"
What good thing happened to you today?,https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/what-good-thing-happened-to-you-today_75/,"This can be as little as finding £2 in your pocket you didn't know you had, or bigger like passing an Exam you was nervous about.

What is yours?"
"New to the forum, love helping people. First post, introduction!",https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/new-to-the-forum-love-helping-people-first-post-introduction_154/,"I'm very new to cyber bullying and what encompasses the term. I do know what bullying is and how being bullied can make one feel. I have been a victim and a bully, when I was seven years old I was bully. Two years later a ran into the young kid whom I had bullied and apologized, afterwards we even spoke and were friendly towards each other.
One question which always comes to mind whenever anyone takes action, is why. I believe the why is very important and leads to the how. With both one can have completely understanding of the situation, even if you're the victim or the onlooker seeking answers to defuse a situation.
I've some theories I wish to share with the community, i'd love to hear everyone's thoughts.
I believe not all victims seek help due to empathy with their aggressor, it's possible even fear of retaliation is a factor. Is it possible that bullying can come from even those we love? I believe it's possible those we love are the ones we let, hurt us the most. Have you ever noticed how difficult it is to say ""no"" to friends? Imagine how many times your friends ask you for a favor, chances are you want to help your friends and are capable, so you do. Sometimes even at greater cost to ourselves do we help our friends and not say ""no"". It's important to know when and how to say no, no matter whom it is. Imagine how difficult it'd be to say no to a complete stranger, for example homeless people. In theory let's say homeless people are bullies of emotions, and they know how to receive our empathy in their own ways in order to get what they want and achieve their own goals. Well, remember saying no is important and so is helping others, but there's a point in which helping others becomes an abuse to oneself. If I lined up 10 homeless people and you have enough food/money to assist 3 homeless people would you? What about the 4th who saw you giving the the first 3 and so forth? Well the moment you give it's your responsibility to say no when you can no longer give. Once you've said no, know it took strength and courage to say no to someone in need when you yourself couldn't give anymore. Bullies take power and refuse to give it back, make sure you say no to bullies who try to take your power, your courage, and your strength."
Why do we put up with bullies?,https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/why-do-we-put-up-with-bullies_164/,"There's a many ways to bully someone besides being physical. The one thing all forms of abuse have is your well being, if you're unhappy in a situation or feel wronged by words said by another and feel beaten down my mere glances. Those are possible situations and signs that you might be bullied and putting up with such things lowers our self esteem and with it the respect we feel for ourselves, once our self esteem is lowered through our own eyes that's when a spiral of negativity forms which is nearly inescapable. Like a hurricane taking everything inside and all the ideas within the hurricane a completely mess of destruction and chaos and there's no bright side to it. At that point we open ourselves up to the worst possible scenarios and every word from a bully feels like daggers piercing through your mind, heart, body, and soul leaving you more scarred than ever. That's when it's best to seek an outside perspective, even through a terrible hurricane if seen from the outside can be beauty, imagine an open farm with a bright sunshine gleaming through the skies, and through the clouds. The entire area is full of greens but at the center is a hurricane. It may seem bad, but it's only one spot out of many and if we take a step back to look at the entire seen we can see where we can go without involving ourselves with the hurricane. Sometimes it's easier to deal with the negative than it is to turn it upside down and see the upside of things, but when we do it's a refreshing feeling and it's not always something you can do alone, not if you're stuck in the hurricane. Seek the hand which seek to help you out."
Cyberbullying and Anxiety,https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/cyberbullying-and-anxiety_125/,"I wanted to address cyberbullying and anxiety. I know that we have a very helpful thread and article on here,that talks about Cyberbullying and Depression. I thought it may be helpful to also talk about anxiety.
Anxiety can elicit a strong physiological response to a perceived or real threat. It can be debilitating and can put our mind and body through the action of flight or fight.
Cyberbullying can exacerbate anxiety or bring it on. It can make us fear the one thing we found joy in. Be it our Facebook or twitter accounts, our emails and even our phone.
Anxiety can manifest differently in each person, and sometimes it's good to know the variations of how it can creep up on you. Moreover, what to do when it does.
For me, my chest can become very tight and painful. I also feel a tingling sensation all through my body and may feel extreme cold or extremely hot.
For some, Anxiety can cause the heart to race or bring on severe nausea. It can be most unpleasant!
When we are online and facing ongoing bullying we may experience Anxiety. Even after the bullying has ended, we may still feel anxious about going online again.
Have you experienced anxious thoughts and sensations as result of bullying?
We can't always switch off online or want too, so what are some of things you've done to cope? What could you share here, that can help fellow cybersmilers to deal with anxiety?"

For Teens & Kids: How Do You Want Your Parents to Support You?,https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/for-teens-kids-how-do-you-want-your-parents-to-support-you_157/,"This question comes from a parent of a pre-teen boy, who doesn't open up like he used to when he has a negative experience with a friend or fellow student:
If you have been bullied or cyberbullied, how do you want your parents to support or help you?
Do you prefer for your parents to ask you a lot of questions?
Leave you alone to work things out by yourself?
Just be available whenever?
My dilemma as a mom is that if I sense my kid is in any pain or turmoil, I want to find out IMMEDIATELY why and get to a solution as quickly as possible. I am trying to respect him and his needs to decompress, but it's tough to stand by as an observer without doing anything.
If you could tell your mom or dad anything about how you want them to interact with you when there's a problem, what would you tell them?
This would be extremely helpful for me, going into the school year.
Thanks, guys!"

How can we get people to be nicer to each other online?,https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/how-can-we-get-people-to-be-nicer-to-each-other-online_143/,"It would be so nice to see the internet used for good instead of hearing these horror stories of people being bullied online until they suffer depression, self harm or even commit suicide. When I hear of initiatives that go viral and really help people such as Cybersmile it makes me think how it would be really exciting to see what we coukd all achieve together if we stopped the hating! Has anybody got any ideas what can be done to get people to be nicer to each other online?"
Is there a stigma attached to Cyberbullying?,https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/is-there-a-stigma-attached-to-cyberbullying_144/,"I have noticed and you probably have too, that many people don't take cyberbullying seriously. Just today, cybersmile posted in their News section about a media personality who slammed a young Youtube star, accusing her of exaggerating the effects of cyberbullying. She argued, that unless it forces the recipient of the abuse to the brink of suicide, it wasn't really bullying. Cybersmile had this to say to that:
""At Cybersmile, we spend all our time helping victims of digital abuse and understand that there is huge variety in the type of bullying that people experience – as well as their ability to cope with different issues. What might seem like nothing to some people can have a big impact on others and it is short sighted to suggest that being called insults and names should not affect people – or that your suffering is only valid if you feel suicidal.""
I think the above is important to keep in mind. But it does highlight a serious issue. There are people out there who believe that online bullying is not that serious. Some believe as highlighted in the article by Cybersmile, that if you choose to be in the public eye, such as making youtube videos, music, sing or act, then you have to accept all manners of abuse. Which when you think about it, is victim blaming.
I have also heard this being said by some adults concerning young people who are part of the gaming world and social media. Constantly I have heard, ""They should just not go on then!"" or ""They are making a choice playing on a live game where all manners of people are"" and worse still, ""If they post pictures of themselves online, what do you think they should expect?""
The above statements are probably more ignorant than malicious. But it demonstrates that many are not aware of how the changing face of communication is now digitalized and it can't just be avoided.
Our definition of being apart of society or social group, includes the digital world now and that is not going to go away.
Have you encountered this yourself? What do you think could help to better educate those that minimize the effects of cyberbullying?"

"Dear parents of gamers, part 2 minecraft.",https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/dear-parents-of-gamers-part-2-minecraft_87/,"Oh? you're back for more? I mean you probably skipped half the old post and just got to the pointers its what everyone wants to read :P. Anyway this is part two of: Dear parents of gamers, including everyone's (don't quote me on that) favourite game minecraft... I think? in this I will be explaining minecraft, how it works, what goes on in it and a few small ,but important, pointers lets go for round two, *ding* *ding*
- Minecraft, AKA: MC, mc and mincecraft
I was insane for minecraft, playing It since early beta, It was all I talked about for years to come and I spent my life on it.I can't even keep track of all the thousands of hours I spent on it. Now minecraft is an interesting game, the frequent updates (though now somewhat infrequent) give minecraft users a continually changing game to keep them interested. The average age for minecraft is... I don't know man grown men play this game and people who haven't even learnt to walk yet do too. The game has 2 options to play most of the time, single player and multiplayer, singleplayer can be paused, exited and the player is In charge of the world completely. Multiplayer however is where things get confusing. There are things called plugins that alter the servers code and therefor way minecraft works a tad in a multiplayer world. The person(s) who own the multiplayer world use something called a server to run it which is pretty much a really large save file that is either accessed on a website (if you purchased it) and will require a password to access. Or it will be stored in a simple file on your pc. You can run these servers on your pc at the expense of how smooth your game runs or you can purchase one from a company that has many powerful computers dedicated to running servers, now back to plugins, plugins are small altercations to minecraft it might let you stop other plays from destroying your land or It could make TNT radius's bigger. Every server has a different set of rules. It is completely up to the owner to make these, usually the rules are: No swearing, No griefing and be respectful; these rules are enforced by admins/mods or the owner and will ban, temporarily ban, kick or warn ( or of plugins allow anything else, that too) anybody who breaks said rules. Rules however can differ COMPLETELY it is in free will of the server owner to make these so I can't list them all but there are servers that have no rules to near none and those ones are called anarchy servers.
I would advise against anarchy servers due to the fact these are most commonly ones that have vulgarity and is most likely to upset people.
Things parents should know about minecraft:
There are quotes that you may hear often a few being: afk, griefing and pvping. afk stands for Away from keyboard meaning someone is still in the game but idle, grieing means destroying someone else's constructions and pvping stands for player vs playering and is when two or more players engage in combat willingly, or unwillingly, whew what a big pointer heh.
Only on rare occasions will you be unable to leave. Pausing does NOT work on multiplayer.
You can donate to servers and sometimes get in-game 'rewards'. But it only works on the multiplayer world you donated to. So spend wisely.
Not 100% sure what I'll be posting about next but there is A LOT of stuff to cover in minecraft and id sit here all year telling you all the stuff I needed to say so to make it easier for all of us I'm just gonna answer any questions you may have in the comment section below and until next time, stay safe gamers ^_^"

I posted a maybe 5 pictures of myself and that was it I never really went on Instagram again. My nickname was something like cream pie or something like that because I really liked coconut cream pie at the time but one of my friends one day texted me and said. ""Dude! You need to look at your Instagram immediately!"" So I tried logging in but I forgot my password so I just hit the ""forgot your password?"" Link and did all the stuff to retrieve a code to reset my password that was going to be sent to my email but I never got the email I kept trying to resend the code then it hit me I typed my email wrong when I signed up! I told my friend that I could not long in so she sent me screen shots of my Instagram comments and things like. ""Hey your a cutie do you have kik?"" ""Hahaha cream pie hahaha!!"" ""Change your name whore!! Hahaha"" ""Your sweet aren't ya? Wanna meet?"" Where Said.. I told my mom because it scared me. She told me she was angry and sad for and at me because I was not allowed to have a Instagram in the first place but she said to not think about it and these people can't find me because I have NO personal information on there but I feel sick to my stomach when I see or hear the word Instagram or see the Instagram logo..

Cyberbullying or arguing?,https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/cyberbullying-or-arguing_142/,"Sometimes we can get into heated, even angry debates online, and long after we've stopped replying we may get some upsetting messages in response. Sometimes these messages can be from strangers or friends.
Equally, Cyberbullying can happen either by a friend or a stranger. Sometimes it can be difficult to discern whether we are being cyberbullied or having a very unpleasant argument online. Has this happened to you?
There's a great section under CyberSmile's FAQ section about what cyberbullying is and how there are many different kinds. I urge you to check it out if you haven't already! But what do you constitute as cyberbullying and do you think the difference is important in how we respond or don't respond?"
Vulnerable people receiving gaming consoles and tech this Christmas,https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/vulnerable-people-receiving-gaming-consoles-and-tech-this-christmas_225/,"I'm worried about the young and vulnerable receiving consoles, smartphones and other internet enabled tech this Christmas without fully being prepared for what they are going to be exposed to online. I'd imagine it's easy at Christmas for parents to leave their children to plug and play their Playstation or Xbox or start going online with their new laptop without making sure the child is ready, or at least show them Cybersmile if they should need it. This isn't about older teens who are more than capable of dealing with abuse online but I'm thinking more about the fact that younger and younger people are using the Internet through their devices. I'd like to hear what everybody else thinks about this? What age is acceptable to leave your child unattended on the Internet? What about with no experience of the Internet? So many questions!"
Are we potentially engaging in cyberbullying just by sharing?,https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/are-we-potentially-engaging-in-cyberbullying-just-by-sharing_219/,"I was recently on Facebook. One of my followers had posted a video that used hidden cameras. The video was of a man ""pranking"" his unaware girlfriend in to thinking he was proposing to her. However, in reality, he declared that he knew she had been cheating on him and broke up with her on camera. This video has been shared thousands of times. I read the comments under the video, Where friends of friends used foul, degrading language about how the girl ""deserved"" it. I was quite disgusted.
These sorts of shaming videos/photos, where the unsuspecting victim is unaware they are being filmed, are on the rise. The comments and posts that follow can be sexist, racist and vulgar. Many of the victims may never even know they were filmed or what is being said about them online. For those that do find out, it can be devastating and life changing.
In saying that, are we complicit in this form of cyberbullying, just by sharing?
If you answered yes, then what can we do to help enlightened our friends or followers that this kind of behaviour is harmful? I was in a position to unfriend this person as I didn't have a close relationship with them but in many cases, it could be your best friend sharing and remarking on these videos. That doesn't necessarily mean they are awful people. We tend to follow the actions of the crowd. So how might you be able to bring this to their attention or how can we collectively, address this issue?"

Paris Attacks & Online Bullying of Muslims,https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/paris-attacks-online-bullying-of-muslims_214/,"Last night one of my dear friends who is Muslim posted something very disturbing to me on Facebook:
She had been in a grocery store and was approached by a man who said he was a ""Christian"" and then verbally assaulted her for the attacks in Paris. She wears a hijab, even in her online photos, so she is easily identifiable. She tried to answer this man very calmly that her faith had nothing to do with the terrorists. He continued to yell at her and physically backed away from her as she tried to address her. She was under the impression that he was deliberately trying to cause a scene and provoke her to prove a point that Muslims are a ""threat.""
She is a grown woman like I am and not a kid, and obviously she can hold her own. But she was extremely upset, and rightfully so.
It got me thinking about kids who are Muslims who are on the Internet. If you're on this site and are Muslim and have been bullied, please know that moms like me care about you and what is happening. Rational people do not blame you for what has happened in Paris. We support you and love you.

The new Twitter Poll option and cyberbullying,https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/the-new-twitter-poll-option-and-cyberbullying_211/,"As many of you avid Twitter users know, There have been some new changes to Twitter. They have recently changed the favorite option to hearts and called it a ""Like"" button and they also added an icon to instantly create your own poll. Both have had mixed reviews by users.
The poll in particular has been used quite creatively and sometimes tongue in cheek. But where my concern lies, is it's potential to be used for more sinister intentions and perhaps already has.
My question is, have you seen the poll being used in a matter that has the potential to hurt or distress another person? What are your thoughts about this new add-on?"

YouTube,https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/youtube_207/,"Hi everyone I just wondered if anyone could give me some advice. I've just been on my YouTube account and Erm wow some of the things people can say.... Telling me to go kill myself etc. Literally can't understand some people, felt bad enough as it was.

Is there help for bullies/harassers?,https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/is-there-help-for-bulliesharassers_210/,"I spend time in the 'wrong end' of YouTube, talking about harassment. So I get a bit. And inevitably talk to my (attempted) abusers. I find a number of aggressors are in need of help themselves. To the extent that I don't feel I have enough qualifications or training to deal with them ethically so have to break off contact at possibly their weakest hour. Cybersmiles doesn't seem quite the right place for them, full of bile and resentment as they are.
Any suggestions?"
Digital Citizenship,https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/digital-citizenship_201/,"I have been reading a lot about the concept of Digital Citizenship and wondered why on earth it is not yet on the school curriculum? We keep hearing how cyberbullying and online abuse is affecting younger people so much, so why aren't schools or the education department looking at this and incorporating it into lessons? Do you think they should?"
SXSW cancelation of abuse in gaming discussion,https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/sxsw-cancelation-of-abuse-in-gaming-discussion_205/,I've just heard that SXSW have cancelled the two discussions scheduled to discuss various forms of abuse and harassment within online gaming. Why have they done this? Surely this just means that the bullies have won and it gives them a bit more strength to continue their misogynistic crusade to ruin the games industry? I really am so disappointed with SXSW Interactive. What do you guys think?
SXSW changed their mind and are doing anti harassment conversation after all!,https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/sxsw-changed-their-mind-and-are-doing-anti-harassment-conversation-after-all_209/,"Only last week I created a topic on here complaining that the SXSW team had cancelled a really important conversation about abuse in gaming at their 2016 event due to threats of violence. Well, in an official statement they have acknowledged that they made a mistake and have now announced a full 1 day Summitt around the subject of online harassment looking at various areas which will no doubt include gaming online. This is great news, what do you guys think? Could it have been PR or do you really think they were going to cancel it?"
Have you ever experienced Cyberbullying in the workplace?,https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/have-you-ever-experienced-cyberbullying-in-the-workplace_206/,"Cyberbullying in the workplace. This can be defined as any bullying done using electronic devices within a working environment or on company property.Such as through company email, company cell phones or even through your own smart devices if a co worker should know your personal email or phone number. Cyberbullying in the workplace can affect any age group or industry.
I myself have experienced this type of cyberbullying but I was lucky to have the support of my company behind me. It can definitely affect productivity, our mental health and professional relationships.
So what are you thoughts about workplace cyberbullying? Have you experienced or witnessed it?
What do you think needs to be done to help reduce or eradicate this issue?"
Racism and cyberbullying.What are your thoughts?,https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/racism-and-cyberbullying-what-are-your-thoughts_195/,"I thought I would touch on a topic that I am sure will resonate with many of you. Racism in cyberspace. Racism continues to be the elephant in the room. It can be both blatantly obvious or subtle. Though great strides have been made in the fight for equality, we still have a long way to go. As globalization and the digital age continues to move forward so does the ability for racism to infiltrate people's lives 24/7. Just like with cyberbullying, racist posts, tweets and texts can have very real damaging and lasting effect on youth and adults of all ages. But it doesn't have to.
We have the ability to stand up to racism in cyberspace and to end racially motivated cyberbullying. Furthermore, we can equip ourselves and others with the right coping strategies when we find ourselves witnessing or experiencing racism online. This can be done through supportive resources (Such as reaching out to the team here at Cybersmile) or through our own efforts of blocking and reporting to the site administrator, informing an adult or walking away from the discussion.
I realize this may be a very difficult discussion for many. But if you would like to openly discuss your experiences with racism, we welcome your posts below. Alternatively, you can of course reach out to the Cybersmile team via email for support.Just to get the discussion started;
Have you ever experienced racially motivated cyberbullying and if so what helped you get through it?
What kind of support would you like to see more of online to help those that are experiencing racism on social media or in gaming?"

CBT in schools,https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/cbt-in-schools_34/,"How would you, or anyone you know think you'd respond to basic theories of CBT (Cognitive behavioural therapy) being taught in schools?
I know I've asked before about opinions of the victim of bullying being able to handle a situation accordingly, how their confidence can be brought up to avoid being bullied. I feel, like many, that we're in a society where emotions are very much shoved to one side and no one really teaches us how best to deal with them. You find these emotions become hidden and kept back even from loved ones and you feel no one really knows how you're feeling. Self esteem and confidence become servilely affected.
So what if concepts of CBT was taught in schools? How to differentiate between facts and opinions, how to pick out your own feelings and work them with accordingly. Would this help with people's mental state and therefore help reduce targets of bullying?
What do you think?"
Cyberbullying in Snapchat- I need help!,https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/cyberbullying-in-snapchat-i-need-help_198/,"Snapchat is an unknown app for me. I don't know if this is a social media like instagram or it is a communication app.
But I know one thing- I'm getting cyberbullied from most of my classmates through it, and I need help from Cybersmile. I don't have a snapchat account, and it's hard for me to use it, but through a close friend I found out very hurtful photos captions and embarrassing videos of me that were sent to unknown people through snapchat, without my permission. In the photos of me those classmates had written very bad stuff such as ""The l******"","" girl that looks like a guy"" and same. These stuff don't hurt me, they just make me angry because they are lies, but the worst is privacy invasion. I can't punch the problems away, since they recorded me fighting with a girl that got into my nerves, and that video became viral on Snapchat. I just can't stop the rumors on this app because I have never used it and I don't know their usernames so I can report them. I need help from Cybersmile, and I think this Snapchat should be shut down forever. I just hate the fact I can't report them so they can see what have they done. I wasn't the only target, even some other friends of mine were. All photos of ours get posted on Snapchat and we can't do anything. Just help!"
Do you trust Facebook?,https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/do-you-trust-facebook_106/,"I don't trust Facebook anymore.

Has anybody seen the Facebook adverts on TV? It creeps me out, it feels like I'm watching the baddie corporation in a movie! Obviously I have the choice to not go on there but I'm worried for people I care about and humanity because they have so much power and influence I don't think they are even worried about Governments anymore."
Are you or fear that you could be a cyberbully?,https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/are-you-or-fear-that-you-could-be-a-cyberbully_179/,"Have you ever wondered if your behaviour online has made you into a cyberbully? Sometimes we can get caught up in our emotions and either mirror a cyberbullies behaviour back at them or for many other reasons we've just started attacking people online.
Sometimes this kind of behaviour is down to the fact we feel angry, lonely and disempowered. We hurt others weaker then us to somehow regain that lost ""power.""
Have you been one of those people and if so, how did you deal with it? Perhaps it's a behaviour you grew out of or wanted to change. But perhaps this is something you aren't sure how to change but would like to.

I'm mum to a teenaged daughter.
I'm very actively underway in cyber space. To me it's important to be well informed about what's going on in our world. And social media has become part of it. I feel I should know at least the basics about that, to be a reliable adviser for my daughter. But I know very few other people of my generation, who think similarly. Much more often I hear, that people of the parent generation are not part of the cyber world and can advise their children only to be careful.

Sexting and Cyberbullying what are your thoughts?,https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/sexting-and-cyberbullying-what-are-your-thoughts_177/,"As I am sure we have all seen in the news and online, sexting is on the rise among young people. A recent qualitative study done by the NSPCC found the following:
-The primary technology-related threat comes from peers, not 'stranger danger'
-sexting is often coercive
-girls are the most adversely affected
-technology amplifies the problem by facilitating the objectification of girls
-sexting reveals wider sexual pressures
-ever younger children are affected
-sexting practices are culturally specific
-more support and resources are vital to redress the gendered sexual pressures on young people.
PARENTS: What have you found difficult about sexting? Have you spoken to your children about it and if so how did it go?
YOUTH: Have you experienced sexting and cyberbulling or know someone who has? What do you think has worked to address or highlight the issue, be it your school or community organization?
If you feel more needs to be done, what would you like to see happen in your schools or home to better equip you and your friends with the right tools when dealing with sexting?

Although I still haven't recovered from my accident I am fit enough to ride again. No more being stuck in my stupid little village in the middle of nowhere! XD I have never, ever taxed and insured anything so quickly! I also love the DVLA (for now anyway!) because they've said I don't need a VIC check which got me back on the road a week or two sooner! Let's hope they're system isn't wrong or Imma soo get pulled by the police o.O I literally cannot express how happy I am to have my bike back, and with that, my freedom.
I would like to take the time though just to say, please please watch out for bikers (not that I don't trust you all) :P But everyone makes mistakes when they are in a rush or aren't concentrating. The only reason I was involved in an accident is because one driver failed to look before pulling out onto a main road. No idea how she missed my hi-vis jacket; I look like a poxy glow stick riding down the road haha! It's just important to bear in mind that most riders involved in accidents are not as lucky as I was. I escaped with my life, and somehow (don't know how) escaped serious injury too! I must have a guardian angel somewhere... Please Think Biker :)"

"New to the forum, love helping people. First post, introduction!",https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/new-to-the-forum-love-helping-people-first-post-introduction_154/,"I'm very new to cyber bullying and what encompasses the term. I do know what bullying is and how being bullied can make one feel. I have been a victim and a bully, when I was seven years old I was bully. Two years later a ran into the young kid whom I had bullied and apologized, afterwards we even spoke and were friendly towards each other.
One question which always comes to mind whenever anyone takes action, is why. I believe the why is very important and leads to the how. With both one can have completely understanding of the situation, even if you're the victim or the onlooker seeking answers to defuse a situation.
I've some theories I wish to share with the community, i'd love to hear everyone's thoughts.
I believe not all victims seek help due to empathy with their aggressor, it's possible even fear of retaliation is a factor. Is it possible that bullying can come from even those we love? I believe it's possible those we love are the ones we let, hurt us the most. Have you ever noticed how difficult it is to say ""no"" to friends? Imagine how many times your friends ask you for a favor, chances are you want to help your friends and are capable, so you do. Sometimes even at greater cost to ourselves do we help our friends and not say ""no"". It's important to know when and how to say no, no matter whom it is. Imagine how difficult it'd be to say no to a complete stranger, for example homeless people. In theory let's say homeless people are bullies of emotions, and they know how to receive our empathy in their own ways in order to get what they want and achieve their own goals. Well, remember saying no is important and so is helping others, but there's a point in which helping others becomes an abuse to oneself. If I lined up 10 homeless people and you have enough food/money to assist 3 homeless people would you? What about the 4th who saw you giving the the first 3 and so forth? Well the moment you give it's your responsibility to say no when you can no longer give. Once you've said no, know it took strength and courage to say no to someone in need when you yourself couldn't give anymore. Bullies take power and refuse to give it back, make sure you say no to bullies who try to take your power, your courage, and your strength."
Why do we put up with bullies?,https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/why-do-we-put-up-with-bullies_164/,"There's a many ways to bully someone besides being physical. The one thing all forms of abuse have is your well being, if you're unhappy in a situation or feel wronged by words said by another and feel beaten down my mere glances. Those are possible situations and signs that you might be bullied and putting up with such things lowers our self esteem and with it the respect we feel for ourselves, once our self esteem is lowered through our own eyes that's when a spiral of negativity forms which is nearly inescapable. Like a hurricane taking everything inside and all the ideas within the hurricane a completely mess of destruction and chaos and there's no bright side to it. At that point we open ourselves up to the worst possible scenarios and every word from a bully feels like daggers piercing through your mind, heart, body, and soul leaving you more scarred than ever. That's when it's best to seek an outside perspective, even through a terrible hurricane if seen from the outside can be beauty, imagine an open farm with a bright sunshine gleaming through the skies, and through the clouds. The entire area is full of greens but at the center is a hurricane. It may seem bad, but it's only one spot out of many and if we take a step back to look at the entire seen we can see where we can go without involving ourselves with the hurricane. Sometimes it's easier to deal with the negative than it is to turn it upside down and see the upside of things, but when we do it's a refreshing feeling and it's not always something you can do alone, not if you're stuck in the hurricane. Seek the hand which seek to help you out."
Cyberbullying and Anxiety,https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/cyberbullying-and-anxiety_125/,"I wanted to address cyberbullying and anxiety. I know that we have a very helpful thread and article on here,that talks about Cyberbullying and Depression. I thought it may be helpful to also talk about anxiety.
Anxiety can elicit a strong physiological response to a perceived or real threat. It can be debilitating and can put our mind and body through the action of flight or fight.
Cyberbullying can exacerbate anxiety or bring it on. It can make us fear the one thing we found joy in. Be it our Facebook or twitter accounts, our emails and even our phone.
Anxiety can manifest differently in each person, and sometimes it's good to know the variations of how it can creep up on you. Moreover, what to do when it does.
For me, my chest can become very tight and painful. I also feel a tingling sensation all through my body and may feel extreme cold or extremely hot.
For some, Anxiety can cause the heart to race or bring on severe nausea. It can be most unpleasant!
When we are online and facing ongoing bullying we may experience Anxiety. Even after the bullying has ended, we may still feel anxious about going online again.
Have you experienced anxious thoughts and sensations as result of bullying?
We can't always switch off online or want too, so what are some of things you've done to cope? What could you share here, that can help fellow cybersmilers to deal with anxiety?"

For Teens & Kids: How Do You Want Your Parents to Support You?,https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/for-teens-kids-how-do-you-want-your-parents-to-support-you_157/,"This question comes from a parent of a pre-teen boy, who doesn't open up like he used to when he has a negative experience with a friend or fellow student:
If you have been bullied or cyberbullied, how do you want your parents to support or help you?
Do you prefer for your parents to ask you a lot of questions?
Leave you alone to work things out by yourself?
Just be available whenever?
My dilemma as a mom is that if I sense my kid is in any pain or turmoil, I want to find out IMMEDIATELY why and get to a solution as quickly as possible. I am trying to respect him and his needs to decompress, but it's tough to stand by as an observer without doing anything.
If you could tell your mom or dad anything about how you want them to interact with you when there's a problem, what would you tell them?
This would be extremely helpful for me, going into the school year.

Is there a stigma attached to Cyberbullying?,https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/is-there-a-stigma-attached-to-cyberbullying_144/,"I have noticed and you probably have too, that many people don't take cyberbullying seriously. Just today, cybersmile posted in their News section about a media personality who slammed a young Youtube star, accusing her of exaggerating the effects of cyberbullying. She argued, that unless it forces the recipient of the abuse to the brink of suicide, it wasn't really bullying. Cybersmile had this to say to that:
""At Cybersmile, we spend all our time helping victims of digital abuse and understand that there is huge variety in the type of bullying that people experience – as well as their ability to cope with different issues. What might seem like nothing to some people can have a big impact on others and it is short sighted to suggest that being called insults and names should not affect people – or that your suffering is only valid if you feel suicidal.""
I think the above is important to keep in mind. But it does highlight a serious issue. There are people out there who believe that online bullying is not that serious. Some believe as highlighted in the article by Cybersmile, that if you choose to be in the public eye, such as making youtube videos, music, sing or act, then you have to accept all manners of abuse. Which when you think about it, is victim blaming.
I have also heard this being said by some adults concerning young people who are part of the gaming world and social media. Constantly I have heard, ""They should just not go on then!"" or ""They are making a choice playing on a live game where all manners of people are"" and worse still, ""If they post pictures of themselves online, what do you think they should expect?""
The above statements are probably more ignorant than malicious. But it demonstrates that many are not aware of how the changing face of communication is now digitalized and it can't just be avoided.
Our definition of being apart of society or social group, includes the digital world now and that is not going to go away.

"Dear parents of gamers, part 2 minecraft.",https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/dear-parents-of-gamers-part-2-minecraft_87/,"Oh? you're back for more? I mean you probably skipped half the old post and just got to the pointers its what everyone wants to read :P. Anyway this is part two of: Dear parents of gamers, including everyone's (don't quote me on that) favourite game minecraft... I think? in this I will be explaining minecraft, how it works, what goes on in it and a few small ,but important, pointers lets go for round two, *ding* *ding*
- Minecraft, AKA: MC, mc and mincecraft
I was insane for minecraft, playing It since early beta, It was all I talked about for years to come and I spent my life on it.I can't even keep track of all the thousands of hours I spent on it. Now minecraft is an interesting game, the frequent updates (though now somewhat infrequent) give minecraft users a continually changing game to keep them interested. The average age for minecraft is... I don't know man grown men play this game and people who haven't even learnt to walk yet do too. The game has 2 options to play most of the time, single player and multiplayer, singleplayer can be paused, exited and the player is In charge of the world completely. Multiplayer however is where things get confusing. There are things called plugins that alter the servers code and therefor way minecraft works a tad in a multiplayer world. The person(s) who own the multiplayer world use something called a server to run it which is pretty much a really large save file that is either accessed on a website (if you purchased it) and will require a password to access. Or it will be stored in a simple file on your pc. You can run these servers on your pc at the expense of how smooth your game runs or you can purchase one from a company that has many powerful computers dedicated to running servers, now back to plugins, plugins are small altercations to minecraft it might let you stop other plays from destroying your land or It could make TNT radius's bigger. Every server has a different set of rules. It is completely up to the owner to make these, usually the rules are: No swearing, No griefing and be respectful; these rules are enforced by admins/mods or the owner and will ban, temporarily ban, kick or warn ( or of plugins allow anything else, that too) anybody who breaks said rules. Rules however can differ COMPLETELY it is in free will of the server owner to make these so I can't list them all but there are servers that have no rules to near none and those ones are called anarchy servers.
I would advise against anarchy servers due to the fact these are most commonly ones that have vulgarity and is most likely to upset people.
Things parents should know about minecraft:
There are quotes that you may hear often a few being: afk, griefing and pvping. afk stands for Away from keyboard meaning someone is still in the game but idle, grieing means destroying someone else's constructions and pvping stands for player vs playering and is when two or more players engage in combat willingly, or unwillingly, whew what a big pointer heh.
Only on rare occasions will you be unable to leave. Pausing does NOT work on multiplayer.
You can donate to servers and sometimes get in-game 'rewards'. But it only works on the multiplayer world you donated to. So spend wisely.
Not 100% sure what I'll be posting about next but there is A LOT of stuff to cover in minecraft and id sit here all year telling you all the stuff I needed to say so to make it easier for all of us I'm just gonna answer any questions you may have in the comment section below and until next time, stay safe gamers ^_^"

I posted a maybe 5 pictures of myself and that was it I never really went on Instagram again. My nickname was something like cream pie or something like that because I really liked coconut cream pie at the time but one of my friends one day texted me and said. ""Dude! You need to look at your Instagram immediately!"" So I tried logging in but I forgot my password so I just hit the ""forgot your password?"" Link and did all the stuff to retrieve a code to reset my password that was going to be sent to my email but I never got the email I kept trying to resend the code then it hit me I typed my email wrong when I signed up! I told my friend that I could not long in so she sent me screen shots of my Instagram comments and things like. ""Hey your a cutie do you have kik?"" ""Hahaha cream pie hahaha!!"" ""Change your name whore!! Hahaha"" ""Your sweet aren't ya? Wanna meet?"" Where Said.. I told my mom because it scared me. She told me she was angry and sad for and at me because I was not allowed to have a Instagram in the first place but she said to not think about it and these people can't find me because I have NO personal information on there but I feel sick to my stomach when I see or hear the word Instagram or see the Instagram logo..

Cyberbullying or arguing?,https://www.cybersmile.org/cyberbullying-support-community/topic/cyberbullying-or-arguing_142/,"Sometimes we can get into heated, even angry debates online, and long after we've stopped replying we may get some upsetting messages in response. Sometimes these messages can be from strangers or friends.
Equally, Cyberbullying can happen either by a friend or a stranger. Sometimes it can be difficult to discern whether we are being cyberbullied or having a very unpleasant argument online. Has this happened to you?
There's a great section under CyberSmile's FAQ section about what cyberbullying is and how there are many different kinds. I urge you to check it out if you haven't already! But what do you constitute as cyberbullying and do you think the difference is important in how we respond or don't respond?"
