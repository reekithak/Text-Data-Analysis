Jenny C(760),"Sorry long post

I’m worried that I’ve caused a bigger problem for my son and he starts school again on Monday.

His “best” friend has become quite manipulative and controlling we’ve had a few issues with other things he’s done but let them slide until earlier this week my son and his friend group organised to go to the cinema and as I was at work my boy asked if he could grab a lift with him and without asking his parents if this was okay said no as we need to bin someone as it’s expensive for one of the mums ( I was paying this mum for My boys ticket)

So my mummy bear instinct kicks in and I think right I’ll message the little so am so mum and see if it’s ok for a lift, yep all’s fine son gets a lift they all have a great time together gets home an hour later best friend is telling my boy that he needs to change in general as he’s at risk of loosing all his friends and he needs to be more rude/impolite etc

We spoke to our son agreed if your not saying thank you to parents it’s comes across rude and that’s not what we taught you.

Our boy was sobbing his heart out and we overheard the conversation got upset and we told him what for before thinking that his parents need to know what’s going on but it’s had to be rational when your kids upset we told him what he’s been happening over summer and how he was handling the situation was wrong there are nicer ways to pull a friend up in politeness other than getting friends involved and ganging up on J And that he should except Jack for who he is and he doesn’t need to change anything else other than improving/remembering his manners

What made us angry was his bf had the issue with my son but felt it necessary to go around the friend group trying to validate himself. And J is willing to be treated like crap just to keep this relationship

I apologised to parents about our knee jerk reaction as it wasn’t the best move and agreed that they should back off for a while but now the friends group are starting to block my son and unfriend him on PS4

I don’t know what to do, I can’t tell my son who he can be friends with but this Bf is toxicSorry long postI’m worried that I’ve caused a bigger problem for my son and he starts school again on Monday.His “best” friend has become quite manipulative and controlling we’ve had a few issues with other things he’s done but let them slide until earlier this week my son and his friend group organised to go to the cinema and as I was at work my boy asked if he could grab a lift with him and without asking his parents if this was okay said no as we need to bin someone as it’s expensive for one of the mums ( I was paying this mum for My boys ticket)So my mummy bear instinct kicks in and I think right I’ll message the little so am so mum and see if it’s ok for a lift, yep all’s fine son gets a lift they all have a great time together gets home an hour later best friend is telling my boy that he needs to change in general as he’s at risk of loosing all his friends and he needs to be more rude/impolite etcWe spoke to our son agreed if your not saying thank you to parents it’s comes across rude and that’s not what we taught you.Our boy was sobbing his heart out and we overheard the conversation got upset and we told him what for before thinking that his parents need to know what’s going on but it’s had to be rational when your kids upset we told him what he’s been happening over summer and how he was handling the situation was wrong there are nicer ways to pull a friend up in politeness other than getting friends involved and ganging up on J And that he should except Jack for who he is and he doesn’t need to change anything else other than improving/remembering his mannersWhat made us angry was his bf had the issue with my son but felt it necessary to go around the friend group trying to validate himself.

Gill B(245),"I need some guidance and hope you might be able to help. My nine year old grandson reacted really badly last night to having to go home with my daughters partner (not his father). He had been with my daughter and her friend at a local hotel since being picked up at school. He had tea there with my daughter but as it was getting a bit late so her partner came to pick him up to get him ready for bed. My daughter said she would be home in an hour as she wanted to stay out a little longer with her friend. My grandson kicked off really badly. He really didn’t want to go with his step dad. He was hysterically crying and being aggressive towards his mum. She made him go. It’s not the first time this has happened but it doesn’t happen all the time. She lives with her partners parents as they are saving up to buy a house. I like her partner but I do think he can be a bit childish and I do worry that he is a little bit bullying sometimes to my grandson who I am very very protective off but also obviously I don’t want to come across as bias.
I don’t like her partners father, he is a bully but fortunately he works away most of the week. She’s not keen on him either. Her Partners mother is lovely and is really good to my daughter and grandson. I feel a bit helpless as I have recently moved away to live in France. I was a huge part of my grandsons life from the very minute he was born. I do feel guilty about leaving him.
However, these incidents are concerning me and my daughter who called me last night to tell me what happened. He also reacts the same way if she says she is going out for the evening and leaving him in the care of her partner.
At first I just thought it was an adjustment to living where he is now, they used to live with me until a year ago, and me moving away. But I’m now worried my grandson is being bullied. I just don’t know how to suggest my daughter handles this.

Nicola E(427),"My daughter is 12 and will be 13 very soon. She has gone through her whole life with no friends. She never got invited to 1 party all the way through school even though we had a party every year practically inviting the whole class she was still left out. One year she had a joint birthday party with her younger sister and only 2 people turned up for her party!! We have done everything from brownies, drama, gymnastics and holiday clubs but she still struggles. She is now in year 8 and has finally found a friend. Her friend has recently just informs her that the only reason she became her friend is because no one likes her. I have no idea what to tell her but I feel so upset by this. I must add that she has dyspraxia and get be very young for her age, she is very touchy feely and we have had to constantly remind her of personal space around other people.My daughter is 12 and will be 13 very soon.

Hayley D(380),"Not the nicest start to the summer holidays when you get into an altercation with some kids parents in the park because they picked on your son...and then their mum threatens to beat you up. And also manages to turn the fact that your kid has autism around on you too as an excuse for your kids behaviour. But I'm also not sure if I overstepped the mark myself on how I handled everything, so opinions welcome supportive or critical. I can't sleep so I'm hoping that writing this out will hwlp. My 4yr DS was minding my own business playing in the park today. He briefly sat down on this trampoline and these kids who looked a few years older told him to move. Not very politely either. He didn't move straight away and the girl grabbed his hat and tossed it. It wasn't in jest, it felt quite aggressive. And what's more even when they saw I was there and I have them a look they didn't seem to care much. My DS is a little on the spectrum and doesn't have all the tools he needs to navigate these things too well. He threw his hat back and stood his ground pretending to be a super hero. Those two kids just kept picking on him for the next 10 mins even though I was holding his hand, which I found pretty shocking tbh. Usually a parents presence would be enough to put a kid off doing that kind of thing. My DS didn't actually seem to bothered but I was really starting to get pissed off. He was ready to leave anyway and while I was helping him put on his shoe they ran past and shouted looser in his ear. It made me jump, and him because he's sensitive to sound. I shouted 'hey' and 'where's your Mum'. Decided I was going to speak to these kids mum. The little girl was crying in lieu of being in trouble and her mum was saying to her friend that 'shes crying because a boy had been horrible to her'. So she was already trying to cover her tracks the little madam. I said what had happened and also said that my kid was on the spectrum. Tbh I'm not too sure why I even mentioned it. Maybe I was looking for sympathy, maybe to make her feel guilty... Before all this happened I'd been watching him play and worrying about his future included the possibility of bullying. And then my greatest fear for him just played out in front of my eyes and my presence didn't even put them off particularly. The mum jumped on that one and said 'well if he's autistic he probably scared her' building on what her little madam had already told her. Not only was that the most ignorant thing to say like ever it was also very much not what happened and that girl definitely wasn't scared of him or me for the most part...Then I made a bigger mistake by saying that her crying was probably because I'd shouted after her. Oppps. Big mistake. These weren't just mums they were hard nosed don't mess with my kids or I'll beat you up kinda mums. Then it became all about the fact I'd 'shouted' all attention now taken away from her own kids faults. 'your lucky there are kids here' she said. 'O now I see where this comes from' I said. She calls me a '****'....I would have preferred ****. I was very calm until I got home and then broke down in tears. I actually felt really shaken by it on so many levels. I don't think I dealt with it perfectly and don't wanna cause someone else's kid to cry....at the same time seeing those kids act with zero kindness and knowing that my DS has few tools was so painful. I don't think it would have played out too well however I'd handled it but I'm actually now a little nervous about going back because I don't much like confrontation.

Lucy C(876),"I hope i'm posting this in right place and hope that some one can give me some advice. I live in a small village, with my husband and 4 children. Our house is right next to a primary school and our garden backs on to school grounds with a path going up to main school building running behind wall of our garden. I hope that makes sense.

Our children dont go to this school as we home educate them due to medical conditions and special needs.

Recently we have started having problems with some of the children that go to this school coming over to our garden wall and throwing stones, rocks and sticks and fir connes at my children and calling them names. My children are just trying to mind there own business playing in garden. 

I'm fed up with it now its got to the point where my children cant play in Garden for fear they might get hurt. Im also concerned that one of these days one of my windows or back doors are going to get smashed. 

It is mainly happening after school. I know the first names of the children but I dont know there parents or where they live.

As it is happening after school can I complain to school or not. They are on school grounds throwing the stones, rocks sticks etc. over.

If not what can I do. These children are not that old they are about 6 or 7 but very big and strong for there age and very mouthy. I have told them to stop and go away and they just laugh. If I shout at them they run away and come straight back as soon as I go away.

any advice would be much appreciated

Asma H(2),"During the last week of school in my daughters class one of the girls decided to initiate a gift exchange event. Each girl would give One girl a gift and would receive a gift from another girl. My daughter dropped off her gift to a girl, but the girl who was supposed to give her a gift never showed up. I can’t help but suspect this was done on purpose. May daughter has been telling me for sometime the girls are giving her a hard time at school. She was new this year and was finding it hard to fit in. We chatted about and I tried to guide her. But since the COVID started we didn’t talk about it much till this happened.

Whenever I ask about what happened to her gift she avoids the topic. I asked her if we should ask about what happed but she does not want to do that and she obviously does not want me to get involved.

I really wanna help her but I don’t know how I’m worried for her as she keeps things to herself.During the last week of school in my daughters class one of the girls decided to initiate a gift exchange event.

Sus70bwr,"I've had problems with my sons primary school for about 18 months now. I will admit my son lacks confidence, is gullible and sometimes moody and has a tendency to hit out physically if someone upsets him. However, he does not feel the need to call his other classmates names, exclude them from his games or deliberately try to get them into trouble which is what is happening to him. I know to the other children he is an easy target but I would rather have my son and his personality any day than the supposed 'friends' that are causing him so much misery.

On a daily basis now he is teased, called names, excluded from games and tormented because his classmates know they can get him into trouble. And it appears to me that the school are playing along with their game as all they are interested in is that my child has hurt another. I on the other hand feel that the source of the problem should be tackled and that the bullies should be confronted. So basically my son is reprimanded for hitting out whilst the bullies get a talking to, he has drawn within himself at school and feels he is not listened to by the teachers.

I have tried to work with the teachers but they seem to be unwilling to admit there is a problem. I have seen their bullying policy and the onus seems to be on the child being bullied being mature about the situation, being able to stand up for themselves and approaching a teacher. But when your child us 7 years old how can they be expected to be mature, how can they stand up for themselves when they feel belittled and how can they approach teachers who they feel do not listen to them. This schools puts far too much importance on resolving a physical problem rather than resolving the source.

I have written to the school and I have had many, many meetings and the overall opinion I get is that they want my child to 'grow up and deal with it', tho they have not said this in so many words. They feel that because my child plays with the bullies that there isn't a problem, but then these children invite him to play for ulterior motives. I find it incredulous that people who work with children fail to recognise a child's gullibility and that it takes maturity to realise how real friends should treat you but also that some children do find pleasure in making others miserable.

Things escalated recently whereby those that he had experienced problems with retaliated themselves outside of the school gates, my son has been assaulted, pushed into a rose bush and most recently chased home whereby he ran across a road. I have again approached the school today, normally my child waits outside but today he was invited to join us. Again I felt I was getting nowhere, they seem to suggest it's just playing, why did they chase him home, did my son provoke them, they really can't accept that he is singled out because the other children know they get a reaction from him, one that normally gets him into trouble. You can probably imagine my frustration and things got a little heated and then they had the nerve to suggest that it was perhaps not in his best interests to hear what was being said and furthermore they suggested that if I spoke about this in this way to him at home that I was probably putting ideas into his head. At that point I got up and walked out taking my son with me.

I talk to my son about any incidents that are reported to me as well as asking him how his day went. I try my best to advise him how to deal with the bullies in a practical way but he is not yet mature enough to take this on board properly. What I refuse to do is make a fuss about anything that has happened, he needs my support and not to be punished at home as well as at school, I need him to be able to talk to me because he sure can't talk to his teachers.

As for the school, it is a poor performing one and a lot of children have been withdrawn and sent to other schools. Having spoken to my son he wants to go to a different school too, I know there is a chance that he will be singled out again but then there is a chance he may not. The school I am considering is the one where the other children went so at least he will know some of them.

Dawn T(4),"Hello all and excuse the rant that's about to take place but i desperatly need some advice or something. We live on a fairly new estate...in a close and our son who is now 6 has been putting up with a nasty, vindictive 9/10 yr old and her brother of 5 since back last summer. Since last year she has made all the other children in our street not want to play with our son...even this morning she got the young children to turn away from us. I'm steaming about this and yes, back last year we spoke to the girl's parents who's answer was &#034;there children&#034; and quickly dismissed the matter. They are not very approachable at all and are very much like their daughter. I am so angry as now no-one bother's to come calling for our son. When we first met this young lady she was very jealous of the toys and things that our son had...and even shocked at the size of our house stating &#034;I thought we had the biggest house&#034; which is a comment i'll never forget. It all started with her trying to get our son to do naughty things of which he refused and then went onto very quickly into shouting nasty things at him - she got right into his face one day...we saw it and said nastily &#034;I DON'T LIKE YOU...I HATE YOU!!&#034; This is when we decided to talk to the parents...as of which you know what they said.....as above. We are not the only parents in the street to put up with this behaviour...another neighbour who has 2 children has also had run-ins with her. They have stopped their chidlren going out and are only allowed to come up and play with our son....for this we are grateful....for our son that is. I'm so frustrated as there was one little girl that our son liked playing with at parties and such and enjoyed an afternoon just last week. Now today we noticed that Madam has got to her and hasn't since bothered coming around since...turning away as did madam this morning. Her family also had a street barbacue...we did not go..as we felt quite itimidated by it and them and all the other parents who's children who ignore our son!!! 

On a lighter note our son loves school and his school friends. He also has weekend activities during term time....swimming lessons and stagecoach which i'm glad about and very fortunate to have due to the fact that it gets him and us out of the street and these kids...into something that he has made some lovely friends...albut they don't live local. I know our son isn't all sugar and spice...he can give as good as he gets but i'm not happy about a 9/10 year old bullying and causing so much negativeness and sadness. She seems to rein in the close/street and all the other children just follow her. What else can we do? Our son has only just turned 6.....how can her parents let and condone her behaviour...her bullying a was then 5 year old and a now 6 year old....i'm so disgusted with their and the other children's parents as we have mentioned it to them once or twice about madam's behaviour - there answer being she's being bullied in school!! Oh so that makes what she's doing to our son okay does it?????

So sorry for this...i do hope it makes sense but i'm more worried than my hubby....he just says ignore it...but i can't. Everytime she's out, she seems to like rubbing our son's nose in the fact that he doesn't have any street friends...not one's that are out often anyway. GRRRRRRRRR....i love where we live....i just dislike living in this close...especially with neighbours of that calibre. Thanks so much for reading though, its very much appreciated xxHello all and excuse the rant that's about to take place but i desperatly need some advice or something. We live on a fairly new estate...in a close and our son who is now 6 has been putting up with a nasty, vindictive 9/10 yr old and her brother of 5 since back last summer. Since last year she has made all the other children in our street not want to play with our son...even this morning she got the young children to turn away from us. I'm steaming about this and yes, back last year we spoke to the girl's parents who's answer was ""there children"" and quickly dismissed the matter. They are not very approachable at all and are very much like their daughter. I am so angry as now no-one bother's to come calling for our son. When we first met this young lady she was very jealous of the toys and things that our son had...and even shocked at the size of our house stating ""I thought we had the biggest house"" which is a comment i'll never forget. It all started with her trying to get our son to do naughty things of which he refused and then went onto very quickly into shouting nasty things at him - she got right into his face one day...we saw it and said nastily ""I DON'T LIKE YOU...I HATE YOU!!"" This is when we decided to talk to the parents...as of which you know what they said.....as above. We are not the only parents in the street to put up with this behaviour...another neighbour who has 2 children has also had run-ins with her. They have stopped their chidlren going out and are only allowed to come up and play with our son....for this we are grateful....for our son that is. I'm so frustrated as there was one little girl that our son liked playing with at parties and such and enjoyed an afternoon just last week. Now today we noticed that Madam has got to her and hasn't since bothered coming around since...turning away as did madam this morning. Her family also had a street barbacue...we did not go..as we felt quite itimidated by it and them and all the other parents who's children who ignore our son!!! On a lighter note our son loves school and his school friends. He also has weekend activities during term time....swimming lessons and stagecoach which i'm glad about and very fortunate to have due to the fact that it gets him and us out of the street and these kids...into something that he has made some lovely friends...albut they don't live local. I know our son isn't all sugar and spice...he can give as good as he gets but i'm not happy about a 9/10 year old bullying and causing so much negativeness and sadness. She seems to rein in the close/street and all the other children just follow her. What else can we do? Our son has only just turned 6.....how can her parents let and condone her behaviour...her bullying a was then 5 year old and a now 6 year old....i'm so disgusted with their and the other children's parents as we have mentioned it to them once or twice about madam's behaviour - there answer being she's being bullied in school!! Oh so that makes what she's doing to our son okay does it?????So sorry for this...i do hope it makes sense but i'm more worried than my hubby....he just says ignore it...but i can't. Everytime she's out, she seems to like rubbing our son's nose in the fact that he doesn't have any street friends...not one's that are out often anyway.

Nicola H(1900),"My daughter started secondary school in sept, I thought although she knew no children in this school she would make the transition well. It was her school of choice. She attended the summer school camp to meet new children, has always been sociable and made friends easily in the past. However the first half term she made friends who then bullied her, which when speaking to the school was stopped. She had other girls she talked to and seemed to get along with them but she changed but we have encouraged her to bring them home, so we could meet them and make friends out if school hours. We have had some sleep over and taken them out shopping and she has been to the pictures with them. However when here they are nice individually but when back at school in groups she is excluded. She has lost weight and become quiet and unhappy, she keeps asking to change schools to the one her primary friends go to. I'm worried she is trying to be like the other girls, who are materialistic and divas and she is not like that. She is lost and unhappy and keeps saying she hasn't got any friends. I have tried to get her to join after school clubs but the girls who bullied her go to the netball club she was interested in now she won't join. Any advice appreciated please a very worried mum!!My daughter started secondary school in sept, I thought although she knew no children in this school she would make the transition well.

Rebecca J(500),"Long story short (you’ll probably be thinking wtf, where’s the rest of the story?) but it’s too long, and believe me when I say this, the end result is the same!

My friend has a dd who turned 2 in jan, my dd is about to turn 3 next month. So just under a year apart. Not a big age gap, but it kind of is when they’re this young, right? That’s not to mention people approach parenting differently which inevitably shapes a child.

My friend, in my opinion has been point scoring against my child. I’ve heard this is common, and seen it at times during my experience as a childcare professional. So I tried to ignore it as it says more about them than it does about the kids who are the victims of this behaviour.

BUT

My friend is now saying that my dd is bullying hers?

Bullying.

Bit of background....
My child is very empathetic, (for a nearly three year old, of course...she’ll make mistakes sometimes but learns from it).

During our regular play dates, my friend’s dd screamed bloody murder because my dd closed a door in their house. (I know you want to say...’there’s gotta be more to that’ but there really, truly isn’t). My dd likes doors closed for some strange reason, her daughter likes doors open. I couldn’t give a F either way, so since it was their house I told my dd to keep the doors open. She didn’t always listen and hey ho the screaming starts again. My friend then goes to tell my child off in front of me.

Then my friend told her dd that she “must stick up for herself”.

I’m not an expert at these things, but is that something she should stick up for herself for? Anyway... my friend then got out a box of thread and beads to stop her dd screaming, after running to her aid and ROCKING HER better... to which my dd was intrigued by the thread and beads as we didn’t have anything like that at home at the time, and helped herself to ONE yellow thread. Oh my word did it all kick off?!?!?! There was NO way I was telling my dd off for playing with a toy. There were so many beads and threads of the same size shape and colour so it wasn’t that she took her favourite one or something. Anyway!!! My dd then, sadly, literally her mouth looked upside down ffs, dropped the little yellow thread and it landed on the girls’s trampoline. Arghhhhhh CHAOS!!!

I hear a huff from my friends direction and she looked so annoyed that my dd didn’t instinctively know that the thread wasn’t allowed there!

She once again told my dd off I front of me! “Don’t put that there, *child A* doesn’t like it there!” To which my dd whispers to me “why mummy?”

Now usually I try to explain things to my dd but I was out of words so I just said “...I don’t have a clue darling.” She then picked the thread back up but my friend took it from her immediately. She then told her own dd “you need to start sticking up for yourself don’t let people bully you”.

OH I FORGOT TO MENTION.. there was a cute fluffy robo cat that belonged to my friends kid and my dd turned it on and was playing gently with it in the opposite corner of the room before the thread incident. My friend told her off for playing with it because her dd was terrified of it and snatched it from my dd’s hands.

That night, I get a long text from my friend going to extreme lengths about how my daughter is bullying hers and was asking my advice on how to teach her dd to stick up for herself ...(get this)... before it gets too much and her dd commits suicide one day.

VSR,"Hi,

Some advice would be appreciated! When I visited my sister last week, my 7 year old niece became very quiet when I asked her about school (she's normally a bubbly, happy child) and she told me she was struggling learning for her S.A.Ts. She then went upstairs to play. As she was still very quiet I went upstairs to find her crying and trying to hide it. Once she calmed down, she said that her teacher keeps shouting at her every time she gets anything wrong. My sister has since heard this teacher does have favourites and has shouted at other children and she is now upset as she had put her daughters upset down to exam nerves. I've told my sister to note down what is said by my niece and to complain to the school. Any advice on how it's best to complain without causing further issues in class (there is no other class to move too)?Hi,Some advice would be appreciated!

Sharon B(1339),"My 13yr old daughter is being bullied again by a girl that we called the police to last summer because of cyber bullying.
This time bully is bullying 2 of my daughters friends as well. Bullying is stalking them around school, calling them names repeatedly, tormenting them &amp; won't leave them alone.
My daughter went to head of year as very upset but on the way home, girl followed her home, bully picked up a stick, called my daughter, said &#034;Look Twig(my daughter is sporty &amp; slim) I've got a weapon.&#034;
She then threw it at my daughter, my daughter unfortunately approached the bully as she didn't hear what she said.
The bully then gave her a hard shove, at which point they started fighting. It was seen &amp; broken up by an adult friend of mine.
I went to school with daughter &amp; spoke to head of year who appeared. Very symphatic but has now given both girls exactly same punishment for fighting of Isolation &amp; after school detention!
She has completely ignored the bullying that was happening, the bullying messages that were sent to my daughter later that night from bully &amp; her friend &amp; totally ignored the bullying policy.
She has just sorted out the fighting because the girls were in school uniform &amp; in the community so brought embarrassment to the school &amp; ignore everything else.
We have tried talking to her again but got nowhere of course.
What can I do now?
All of this is making me suicidal, I haven't stopped crying about it since because it is so wrong, unjust &amp; I cannot do anything about it.

Soso M(2),"Dear friends , 
So i had an unpleasent incident happened with my neighbours kids , i moved around 7 months ago to this new place and of course all the kids in the neighbourhood share the same school and playground , so my 7 years old son is very social , he liked to play with the neighbours kids in the playground , i didnt really know them well i just see them in the playground , but she just seemed like a normal mom , one day she came to me looking very angry and ganging with other neighbour who was her friend from before i moved , and accusing that my son is fighting with her son at school everyday , and she and her friend was threating me that they will tell everyone to not play with my son , i was so shocked i thought they are good neighbours but they were very rude it does seem that this is thier real face , i thought for my son benefit to go to the neighbour and say sorry about anything happened between the kids before , then i went to the school and asked if my son had any problems the teacher and principal said my son never got into fights , i know my son he like to follow the rules at school and doesnt like to get in trouble , after that other bullying incidents happened from the same neighbour kids but it stoped after i complained many times to the school .

Unlucky for me , The sad situation is that we have to interact with these neighbours alot in the future on daily basis , i have no idea how to deal with them , and i have no idea how to stop thier kids from ganging aganist my son and stop them form stealing my son friends , and telling other kids to stop playing with him , of course my son doesnt like the school and he wish he dont go to this school .

Nick J(36),"Hi,
I am hoping there may be someone in the profession that may work in a primary school that have dealt with bullying or similar and can offer advice.

My 8 year old attends a very popular and reputable primary school in a lovely area and is in year 4. During year 1 another child arrived from a different local school. Since then we have had to speak to teachers frequently about this child’s behaviour towards my own child. We have a long list of instances of name calling, following, pinching, squeezing, goading, shouting, shoving...etc. We also have a list of which teacher we have spoken to at school with dates.

We have always been assured by class teachers that it was in hand and being dealt with but the current teacher doesn’t seem interested. He sees it as this bully child being isolated as other children will not play with them due to their nastiness - it has happened to other children as well, not just my child, but it has continued regularly for my child and not others. He has tried to force my child to play with this bully and recently another member of staff called my child out of class one afternoon to tell her she must play with this bully child!

Recently the mum of the bully accompanied the children on a school outing and slated my child in front of all children (but not the teacher) and my child was very upset. We were furious and escalated it to the head teacher rather than speaking with class teacher this time.

We met with the head after a series of emails and she asked us to bring our log of events/talks with teachers which we did and she took a copy. She also told us that due to it being a safeguarding issue, the bully’s mum can no longer attend school trips. This was after she spoke to the mum in question who I assume admitted what she had said.

Going forwards they have proposed a plan for both my child and the bully child. They each choose a buddy they can go to at playtimes if they are upset, they have a special book each they can write in each day about good and bad things that have happened that day and they both meet with a support teacher once a week, together to talk about behaviour strategies. They will also not play or learn together although they will remain in the same class.

We are happy that finally something is being done but we are unhappy that the school are now treating both children the same. I do not feel my child needs these special measures in place, her behaviour has always been of a good standard. The school have said they have to disregard all of what has happened previously - even instances that happened in recent weeks - as they have no log of any of our talks with teachers in the past!

We wanted to cooperate and have gone along with their suggestion of separating the children at all times and the special measures of a buddy etc. Although we weren’t happy at involving other children - it’s a responsibility for children to be a buddy and the issue would no longer remain private however we’ve had to suck it up for the sake of moving forwards some how and thought it’s only one buddy each that will be involved.

This system has been in place for a couple of weeks and two days ago they have been told they now must choose a different buddy and switch every few days. We aren’t happy that this wasn’t communicated to us and now it means this whole situation is becoming even more common knowledge amongst kids and parents to an extent that “gossip”
Was flying around the classroom as the bully and their buddy told lots of other children. The teacher told them it was to be kept quiet but they have ignored that instruction. So to quash the gossip, the class teacher spoke to the whole class and told them that two children in the class have a buddy etc but he didn’t say who although the bully child shouted out to the class and identifies themselves as one of them.

My child is very upset and feels embarrassed at having to have a buddy and having to see the support teacher and also feels annoyed that the bully gets the same treatment when my child hasn’t done all these things such as name calling etc.

The school have said it’s basically tough if we don’t like the system in place, they are trialing it for three months and will then review. We are annoyed that it is no longer confidential and they have said my child is also guilty of talking about it with other children. My child assured us they haven’t and I believe that but the teacher thinks he “had evidence to suggest otherwise” and he sees my child playing with the bully sometimes and he says has “witnesses of five other staff members”. My child assured us she doesn’t play with the bully or go near her, we know she hasn’t for some time. We also know that recently staff incorrectly reported seeing my child with the bully - it turned out they got confused with children’s names.

My child is really unhappy and so are we. If they had only dealt with all of this before we don’t feel it would have escalated to this and we don’t like the school’s attitude of it being tough on us/my child. We are considering moving schools as ‘the school seems afraid to deal with a bully and treating the innocent ones as if they are at fault as well.

Does anyone have any suggestions that I can put to them? Any effective methods as an alternative?Hi,I am hoping there may be someone in the profession that may work in a primary school that have dealt with bullying or similar and can offer advice.My 8 year old attends a very popular and reputable primary school in a lovely area and is in year 4.

If they had only dealt with all of this before we don’t feel it would have escalated to this and we don’t like the school’s attitude of it being tough on us/my child. We are considering moving schools as ‘the school seems afraid to deal with a bully and treating the innocent ones as if they are at fault as well.Does anyone have any suggestions that I can put to them? Any effective methods as an alternative?Post quoted 1 times",2,66, 13-02-2020 at 4.17PM

LOUISE D(550),"I am feeling a bit low due to issues with my husband and his brother making my life difficult.

I was subject to 20 years of coercive control by my husband.

So when he moved out I was relieved but scared as he left us to face homelessness.

I have now been offered a housing association property and managed to find employment, something that my husband never liked me to do when he lived with me. He did not like the idea of me having a life outside of the house, hence why I can not even drive, and had a 20 year break from work.

Anyway I finally found myself breaking free from his control, but now I have another obstacle in my way.
In the form of my brother in law who has never met me, and only knows what my husband tells him about me. My husband used to exclude me from family meetings with his siblings, so none of them really know me.

My husband's brother has been making malicious calls against me to the social services and police.
It's beyond a joke now.
Although the police initially telephoned me and described my brother in laws behaviour as ridiculous and social services said they'd no cause for concern and suggested my brother in law may be harassing me.

So I emailed my brother in law politely requesting he leave me alone. But he sent a policeman round to my home and I got told off for contacting him!

To make matters worse I think my husband has given his brother my work address and new home address, and I am on edge worrying that the malicious calls will continue.

I feel as if I will never truly be free from my husband's control and now it seems his brother has joined forces with him to make my life a misery.

I just don't know where to turn.

Lisa G(1143),"Hello,

I need some netmum advice. Il make this the short version.

My daughter started a new school in September (year 1) and from the beginning I have felt the teacher has disliked my child by the way she talks about her etc. My afterschool club who aren’t involved with the school pick her up each day and they have also noticed it.

The afterschool then put in a complaint a while back after being unhappy about the teacher pushing her towards them. Nothing was done

Fast forward a month.

I get a phone call stating daughter came out of school crying saying she didn’t like said teacher, that the teacher hurt her by grabbing her wrist and pushing her to the floor.
The Afterschool then checked her wrist and found adult finger marks and have put in a safeguarding complaint.
The teacher has been suspended pending further investigation. The problem is the other parents don’t know yet, and I’m worrying about how they will react? I’m also worrying as one of the parents in the class is related to the teacher. I don’t know what to Do.

I feel so stressed about it all.

Many thanks

Keighley W(6),"Hi everyone. I’m just looking for other mums opinions on a situation with my sons school. 

He is currently in year 1, has been there since reception. I was called in last month by them and they brought to my attention that they felt my son was dealing with some anxiety and they wanted him to attend a form of counselling at the school. I had noticed a change in his behaviour myself, have recently been suffering with my mental health so obviously I agreed to this. 

Later on in that week, while standing in the playground, with a teacher, a girl from his class decided to kick my son in the shin and stamp on his feet. As the teacher didn’t feel to step in, I obviously did. Safe to say the teacher was not happy with my instructions to my son regarding this. 

Now yesterday on the way to school my son asked me what a certain finger signal meant! I’m sure I don’t need to explain what it was. I know this is not something he’s picked up from home so pressed for more info. I brought this to the heads attention straight away who said she will look into it. When I collected him I asked if he had pointed out the girl to his head, he replied yes so I didn’t dig any further as I had a meeting planned with the head for tomorrow to discuss it. Later on in the evening I found him crying. It then came out that the head pulled this girl in front of him, asked her and she said my son was lying. He now feels that no one is going to believe him because she is older. I know they spoke to other children that were there and they all confirmed what my son said. They also stated that this girl didn’t attempt to get anyone else in the group at the time to do the finger gesture apart from my 5 year old. 

The head said to me today that she has never seen my son interacting with this girl which I know is a lie. She lives across the road from me and if we see her in the mornings, she says morning to my son, by his name and has done for over a year! 

I still have a meeting with the head tomorrow but I am at a place where I am debating pulling him from the school. Not because of this specific incident but a build up of incidents. He’s had 2 school jumpers stolen, hat, scarf and even a pair or trainers. We’ve also been dealing with him not wanting to go in, complaining of belly ache, headache, not feeling well. He has also started hiding behind doors, covering his face, sobbing, apologising when I tell him off. Now I do not hit my son, I have no need to so why is he doing this? I have tried to speak to him but don’t seem to get anywhere. My gut is telling me there is either more going on then the school are telling me or they just aren’t aware. 

Any advice from mums that may have gone through this or something like it would be greatly appreciated. I just want to make the best decision for my son.Hi everyone.

Leanne M(779),"A little while ago another mother at my DS's primary school approached me and told my DD had been bullying her child for months (she gave no examples). We used to be close friends (or so I thought) with this family, spending time together at weekends, going on holiday together, and our DC used to play with each other after school. All that faded out slowly over the course of the past few months, and I had no idea why until that day when I heard the accusations. I then obviously contacted the school, who have since repeatedly reassured me that they have not seen any malicious behaviour by my DD towards the other child. My daughter herself doesn't understand either what she is supposed to be doing wrong. Particularly confusing is the fact that the other child will often still seek her out to play with, invited her to their (very small) birthday party, etc. Yet, this other mum continues to go into the school daily to complain about my daughter saying her child spends hours each day crying, not learning, not sleeping - all because of my DD. The school seem to be on our side but because of the ongoing complaints are now taking further steps (inviting us in, asking us to read the anti-bullying policy, keeping diaries, etc.). Am I wrong to think my child is being scapegoated here? The whole issue is having a huge effect on my own mental health (luckily my DD's skin is much thicker); it's a small school in a small village, and I am now constantly feeling paranoid about what the rest of the parents might think of us. The other mum has a way of wrapping people around her finger (like she used to do with me) and a big following within the parent community. Any advice would be much appreciated.A little while ago another mother at my DS's primary school approached me and told my DD had been bullying her child for months (she gave no examples).

Emma B(2538),"So 2 weeks ago I watched as a play fight between my son and another boy in his class got out of hand in the playground after school. I immediately ran to them to break it up. I had to run past the other boys mum to get to them and she was just sat there watching. The other kid is twice the size of my boy and had the upper hand. My child was on the floor while he was punching him . Don’t get me wrong my son was giving it all he had, he is just not as big or strong as the other boy. I pulled them apart and said come on we are going. We walked away and the child ran at my son and shoved him from behind , he then turned round and stuck his middle finger up in my sons face! They are 6 years old! My son doesn’t know what this gesture means! At this point I turn to to mother and say what the hell is going on and she said her son has had trouble with my boy and that the teachers were going to have a word! Teachers haven’t said one word! I then went to school the next day and asked the class teacher about it and as we were talking this other mother stormed up being very agitated and shouty. I felt mortified. The class teacher told me she hadn’t informed me of the complaint as the matter was minor and was dealt with at school. Basically my kid didn’t want to play with the other kid. I’ve spoken to my child and said it’s ok not to like everyone but u need to be kind which he has promised to do. (4 days later) after school the kid ran up to my boy and said do u want to play? My kid said yes and off they went then the other boy said to me we are friends now to which I said brilliant. That was Thursday. Then Monday I get a call from the school asking to go in. I go in for a meeting with the head and she has said the mother has made another complaint against my child! I was flabbergasted . So from Thursday pm they are fine to Monday morning they are not. The child has now been off school for 6 days! Is this due to my son???? The head teacher has told me they have observed my son as have other teachers, dinner ladies etc and they have all said he is fine and nothing to note. So as far as I’m concerned unless proved otherwise my son is fine! What should I do about all this?? I feel like I want my kids name to be cleAred! I spoke to the head this morning and said is everything all ok now but she said the boy has been off all week but they have some ideas about what to do when he is back!

Elizabeth1​45,"Sorry for the long message! Since last autumn my 9 year old (nearly 10) daughter has been befriended by a girl (who is a physically mature 11 year old) in her mixed year group class after their teacher suggested they play together. My daughter was always friendly and popular with most of the other children in her class. The new friend has pulled her in and become incredibly controlling. My daughter now feels unable to play with her other friends or her siblings at the school. 

My daughter has given numerous examples of when this girl has been bossy, controlling and manipulative and she apparently often tells my daughter she should be more like her etc which makes my daughter feel upset. It isn’t helped by the girl wanting my daughter to help set her up with a boy in their class. My daughter feels very uncomfortable with this. My daughter doesn’t want to be friends with this girl anymore, but hasn’t the confidence to stand up to her as she is scared what she will say to the other children. 

Does the behaviour of the ‘friend’ sound unreasonable? My daughter is worried that she is being the bad friend because she isn’t being understanding of the girl or that maybe she is making the friend feel upset because she is trying to distance herself from her. 

Bullying is such a strong word that I don’t want to use it out of turn, but I am worried about how strong an impact this is having on my daughter. I will be contacting the school to discuss a way forward with them but any advice would be appreciated.Sorry for the long message! Since last autumn my 9 year old (nearly 10) daughter has been befriended by a girl (who is a physically mature 11 year old) in her mixed year group class after their teacher suggested they play together. My daughter was always friendly and popular with most of the other children in her class. The new friend has pulled her in and become incredibly controlling. My daughter now feels unable to play with her other friends or her siblings at the school. My daughter has given numerous examples of when this girl has been bossy, controlling and manipulative and she apparently often tells my daughter she should be more like her etc which makes my daughter feel upset. It isn’t helped by the girl wanting my daughter to help set her up with a boy in their class. My daughter feels very uncomfortable with this. My daughter doesn’t want to be friends with this girl anymore, but hasn’t the confidence to stand up to her as she is scared what she will say to the other children. Does the behaviour of the ‘friend’ sound unreasonable? My daughter is worried that she is being the bad friend because she isn’t being understanding of the girl or that maybe she is making the friend feel upset because she is trying to distance herself from her. Bullying is such a strong word that I don’t want to use it out of turn, but I am worried about how strong an impact this is having on my daughter. I will be contacting the school to discuss a way forward with them but any advice would be appreciated.",6,665, 03-06-2019 at 10.43PM  
Sharon A(387),"My son is 12 and he is being bullied in school. I’ve been into school 2/3 times and we don’t seem to be getting anywhere.
My son has just told me of another incident today (in tears) and I quickly emailed the lady who is supposed to be dealing with my son.
I’m still waiting on a call from her on the 24th May! 
I explained that I didn’t think my son was getting any help and that we both felt let down. I also said he wouldn’t be back in school until something could be done and I asked them to send his work home. (I’d collect).
My question is can I get in trouble for this? Or what else should I do?
It breaks my heart to hear of what he has to put up with and it’s making us both miserable. I don’t know what to do t help him.

kim92x,"Hello, im after some advice, ive live on a housing estate for 3 years my son used to get on with all the kids UNTIL about a month ago. I had told 1 of the children to stop climbing on the fence at the bottom of the drive, also i had witnessed another one of the kids throw a bottle over a fence so i told the young girl that it was dangerous as its used to walk horses to and from fields ect. I clearly told her i wasnt telling her off. Anyway a week passed and my son asked to go the front (there is a small park) i said yes and off he went. Within 5 minutes he came in crying saying no one want to be his friend because i had told his friends off, one of the mums has got mouthy on social media at me making out her children are angels when they aint. The kids in question have told all the other kids to not play with him they shout names at him when hes out om his bike, they throw stuff at him this has been going on for about a month now. any advice on what to do? The children range from 5years to 12 years old

My little girl aged 9, who has Asperger's, has been targeted by older children (different children each time) in her new school (I moved her as class sizes were much smaller and I thought she would find it easier to cope/learn there) but she has been targeted several times by bullies.

Lau79gfv,"My son is 8 years old, he has been having problems with a child who has autism since reception being hurt, kissed, licked, having pens thrown at him, Yesterday he was jumped on pulled to the ground and repeatedly jumped on his ribs and punched in the head whilst he was on the ground.

I used to tell him not to retaliate but honestly I am sick of it all now I have told him he has every right to defend himself as there are so many of these incidents now. He doesnt defend himself though unfortunately hes just not the fighting type he doesnt want to fight with anyone.
I have emailed the head teacher and gone into the school this morning about it and they said that they were going to look at the cctv that they hadnt done yet as the child had admitted to beating my son up but they were going to have a meeting about what happened yesterday today.
I feel the older this child gets the stronger he will get and whatever they do to him to punish him (which doesnt appear to be an awful lot) it doesnt and obviously hasnt worked.
How much violence can he get away with before he is kicked out the school?
How much violence does your school tolerate before someone is kicked out or at least suspended?
I would change my childs school but unfortunately my daughter goes there and is very happy and I wont be able to drop them off at two different schools at the same time.My son is 8 years old, he has been having problems with a child who has autism since reception being hurt, kissed, licked, having pens thrown at him, Yesterday he was jumped on pulled to the ground and repeatedly jumped on his ribs and punched in the head whilst he was on the ground.

georginael​iizabeth,"Hi,

My son is eight years old and for his birthday I got him a playstation 3 (worse thing I ever did ).
Then after talking to another mum she mentioned there was an online pass and how they can talk and play with each other. My son was happy to play alone at first and set everything to play alone. 

I jumped on the band wagon and then said he could play with his friends if he got an online pass. He only plays with friends that he knows though and some friends of friends if he knows them. I did delete Fortnite because I felt it was making him angry and it was a struggle to get him off it, even to go to his sports through out the week/weekend. How ever he then re down loaded it even though he has other games.

Then I saw on messenger a friend from school had called him gay so I thought the right thing to do was reply and say don’t call son gay and he then asked my son how I saw it and he explained that I his mum, can see all his messages. 

I was really worried if he was being bullied at school even though I know he would have told me as he tells me when he’s been good and silly. Anyways my son told me his friend apologised and my son was really upset that I was upset about his so called friend calling him that as I felt like he was defending him and was over worrying. I under kids at that age make up and break up don’t they. 

How ever he has called it him again and uses words like ********, ****, swear words that I would never dream of hearing at that age. And now my son has picked up on those words as well and has even called me an **** hole. My son has also said words back now like weirdo, apologised for being mean and when he was called an ‘idiot gay boy’ ‘screw you mother ****er’ ‘you are a gay boy’ etc.. he just ignored it.

Am I right in wanting to talk to the school about it because I feel hurt by these words, maybe more than my son does? Or whether it’s just kids being kids and to just keep an eye on it for now until my son tells/shows me it’s bothering him?

I know he probably wants to still be friends with him so it’s a tricky one.

So In my 6 year old sons class there is a little boy who has 1:1 support. He has behavioural issues, not too sure what or any other needs he has. However he keeps lashing out at my child. He was kicked today (teacher told me on pick up) and a week ago he was punched full force in the eye, he couldn’t see for a few minutes. These attacks are unprovoked the teacher has said but assured me they are dealing with the child involved. I understand he has issues but am really upset this keeps happening! How would other parents handle this? x

Sue H(802),"Sorry for the long post and thank you in advance for reading. So...back in August social services told me that if I didn’t separate from my husband then they would seek legal action for removal of my children. We were put on child protection initially due to my mental health and then it came to light my husbands behaviour. I was 6 months pregnant at the time and became very scared and compliant. I made plans to evict my husband the following July.

Back story leading to social services request to separate. 
I’m not sugar coating this in any way, nor am I saying what he did was ok, because it wasn’t. He was very controlling and mentally abusive. He would track my phone, follow me, go nuts at me if I lied to him about where I was. He didn’t get on well with my eldest son from my first ex husband. He didn’t like me taking contraception and so I ended up pregnant 3 years running. He wasn’t engaging well with children services. The last incident before I asked him to leave was this. He asked to go through my phone and I said no. He grabbed my phone and threw it at the window breaking the window and my phone in the process. I was devastated at that incident because my children were home and God forbid anything happens to them.That was my breaking point and knew then what I had to do.

When he left I got a court order and started divorce proceedings at children’s services request. I gave birth to my beautiful daughter and everything has gone smoothly since he left.The children came off of child protection and onto child in need which was amazing.

I have started talking to my husband (divorce hasn’t gone through yet) again and I think, well I hope he realises the seriousness of his actions. I have fallen in love with him all over again and I want him to be a part of the family. However I don’t condone what he did or how he was. Firstly he wouldn’t be moving straight back in, I have asked him to get in touch with the social worker and ask them directly what he needs to do.They wanted him to do a perpetrator course so I’m guessing that this would be the case again. I personally have started the freedom program which is very enlightening. I do believe that he wants the right help and until then he will not be allowed back home. I know he has the potential to be a good father and a loving husband. There is no way I will put my babies at risk by having him come straight home and I would only have him here with social services help and guidance. Should I call child services and see what they say? The last thing I want to do is risk the children’s happiness but I honestly believe he wants to be a good father. I love this man so so much and it broke my heart when I had to give up on my marriage. I don’t want to be selfish at all. Does anyone have any advice please.

Kerry M(934),"Hello all I’m at a loose end on what to do here. It’s a long one so here goes...

I have a 2 and a half year old DD. I have been separated from her father for over a year and a half now. 

He has a partner- been with her for about a year. She has a 5yo daughter.

He works offshore on a 4/4 rotation so when he’s home he’ll have our DD 2 nights a week. 

Now as far as I was aware my DD and the new partners DD got on well and loved playing with each other and while my daughters dad is away his new partner has offered to have my daughter now and again. However over the last month the following has happened... CMS got in touch to say that payments are being reduced as my ex had told them he has her a lot more than he does, I was initially confused as I had told them the exact schedule as to when he has her. However came to realise he is now counting when his partner has her. I innocently explained this to CMS and to why I was confused and they came back and said that it doesn’t count when she has her it’s only when he has her for a full night.

My main concern is that a couple of weeks ago I offered to help his partner out and looked after her DD while she went to work for a couple of hours. I thought it would be lovey for my daughter to have her round to play. How wrong was I!? In the first 10 minutes of being in my house my daughter had been kicked twice and slapped across her face. BY A 5 YEAR OLD!? I was quite disgusted by her behaviour. However what shocked me more is that my DD didn’t even react. she has been left with a bruise so it wasn’t just a little kick either. I made me think that she’s used to this and it made me so sad that she is so accepting of being treated like this? She also broke one of my DD’s toys deliberately, threw a 50p coin at me and snatched any toy my daughter had away from her - gain my daughter didn’t seemed fazed by this 😥😥😥

My ex is due home later tonight but isn’t having my DD this weekend as he “has plans” (will be in pub all weekend). I have tried hard to keep up my DD and fathers relationship which I feel I shouldn’t have to do.. he should be desperate to see her. However I wonder if men are just wired up different to women 🤔

So anyway earlier this morning my ex text to say that since he is paying so much in CMS payments to me he wants to have my DD for an extra night per weekso he’s not paying so much. however am I wrong in feeling like I would rather it be when his partners DD isn’t there? I’m reluctant to change the nights anyway as he usually cancels at least 2 of his nights with our DD as it is. I really thought that my daughter was being clingy to me if I leave her but now I’m so scared it’s because she’s being treated like this at their house? What can I do about it? Any experiences and advice welcome Iv been stressed and worrying all day!

(Also just for background we both have parental rights as we did not go to court for a custody battle- so do I have a right to say he can’t have her an extra night if it’ll be with the partners DD??)

Julie E(309),"Hi there, Im new to Net mums but I feel like I am going crazy and needed to vent a little !

So my question is what do you do about confrontational mums? 

My daughter has borderline ADHD and is currently undergoing diagnosis - she is 10. A few months ago we moved into a new house, and she met a friend who lived over the road, so I allowed her to play out on the green in front of the house on her bike.

As girls do, fallout after fallout ensued, and my daughter was always coming home upset from these playouts, but I want her to know how to sort out these problems, so as long as I felt there was no bullying or voilence from the other child, I let her play out. 

Then one day her mum came to my door, telling me that my daughter was being mean. I told her from my side that my dd was also saying the same about hers, but this mum insisted that her child wouldn't lie and that it was my child to blame. I made both girls apologise and they were fine again for a few days.

One day, the girl asked for a sleepover and I agreed, and wouldn't you guess, they had a fall out - at about 11pm in the evening. The girl asked to go home, so I text her mum. My daughter was so distraught and embarrassed that she was leaving that she began a full on tantrum, and started slamming doors, screaming, it was all very embarrassing and as soon as the mum came to the door, she looked a bit shocked, but took her daughter, and I ran upstairs to calm mine down. 

The other mum decided that 10yr old kids shouldn't have tantrums and her daughter wasn't allowed to play with mine anymore. 

So anyway, a few things happened, and they made friends and were able to play again. But this morning, I was looking out the window and I saw the friend and another new girl (K) telling my daughter to go away, and being quite mean, so I went out to them and asked them politely to stop this, and they agreed and said sorry. Later that day, the same thing happened, so I went over again The other girl (K) had at this point followed my dd's friend into her house, and the friends mum was unpacking her car, so I asked her mum if I could speak with K. Her mum proceeded to lay into me again about my daughter, telling me I shouldn't be talking to children without their parents present (even though she had done so with most of the children on the street) , and that my daughter was a lyer and I was (in so much words) a bad mother because her child wouldnt have tantrums and scream and throw things. I explained that that is a normal 10yr old tantrum and is quite common, but I'm sad to say it turned into a shouting match with me insisting my daughter was not lying and that I'd seen the whole thing, and her saying that I was a bad parent, and my daughter was a bad kid. I came away fuming.

I wouldn't mind, but I have spoken to this lady three times, she's not a friend, doesn't know me, and people who do know me say that me and my dd are the most loving parent/child pair and I am very fair. I practice 1, 2, 3 magic with my dd, and there are odd occasions where it doesn't work, but on the whole, considering her difficulties, she is a good kid, with boundaries in place.

I feel so angry that someone could talk like that to me in front of not only her daughter, and the other friend (K), but also my own daughter. I wanted to punch her to be honest, it took a lot not to, and I am not voilent in the slightest.. ever! It felt like she wanted an arguement as soon as I went over there.

How can I avoid this kind of confrontation? I feel like the only option is to stop my dd playing out .. but I am sad about this as it's the first year I have allowed her to do this and she enjoys it. 

Worst of all is how angry I feel that some parents feel like their kids are angels, and would rather argue in the street with another mum that to accept that it may just be kids being kids.. is this overprotectiveness? Also, this parent knows my dd has borderline ADHD so I feel she is using this to blame her instead of realising there are two sides.. I need parent to parent thoughts on this.. what would you do? 

Thanks so much xxxHi there, Im new to Net mums but I feel like I am going crazy and needed to vent a little !So my question is what do you do about confrontational mums? My daughter has borderline ADHD and is currently undergoing diagnosis - she is 10. A few months ago we moved into a new house, and she met a friend who lived over the road, so I allowed her to play out on the green in front of the house on her bike.As girls do, fallout after fallout ensued, and my daughter was always coming home upset from these playouts, but I want her to know how to sort out these problems, so as long as I felt there was no bullying or voilence from the other child, I let her play out. Then one day her mum came to my door, telling me that my daughter was being mean. I told her from my side that my dd was also saying the same about hers, but this mum insisted that her child wouldn't lie and that it was my child to blame. I made both girls apologise and they were fine again for a few days.One day, the girl asked for a sleepover and I agreed, and wouldn't you guess, they had a fall out - at about 11pm in the evening. The girl asked to go home, so I text her mum. My daughter was so distraught and embarrassed that she was leaving that she began a full on tantrum, and started slamming doors, screaming, it was all very embarrassing and as soon as the mum came to the door, she looked a bit shocked, but took her daughter, and I ran upstairs to calm mine down.

I took my daughter to a play centre on Saturday and as I was just sat watching my daughter who was just sat on the floor flicking her hands minding her own business (she has autism and servere learning difficulties) this older girl aged about 7 or 8 came behind my daughter and pushed her from behind so she went face first on to the floor as I got up as I saw what was going on, I then saw this girl turn back round and then proceed to stamp on my daughter. To see someone do this to my daughter for no other reason then because she is different has really upset me. I asked the girl why she did it and she said she didn't know why, after 5 mins of me and her aunt asking she said my daughter had been grabbing her (not what I saw) so I contacted the play centre and they have checked there cc tv and told me it was totally unprovoked and it looked quite nasty. I'm now thinking of contacting the police about this matter. What should I do?

Deleted profile,"My DD is 7 overly friendly, doesnt understand boundaries at time and can come across as overly emotional with her peers. She loves people, but cannot sense when she is being overwhelming with her approach. 

Today was the first day back at school and en route we saw 2 kids from her class. She ran to catch up with them so they deliberately ran faster away from her. I ignored that but she became quite distressed but managed to catch up with them. When she did, they started rolling their eyes and saying nasty things to her. 

It actually upset me a bit. One of the kids is miserable, literally face like a slapped backside and even his mother tries to egg him on to smile in the playground but hes always negative. That one i ignored because he is always negativr and was only copying the other kid.

The other kid got a bit of a telling off from his parent but was even saying nasty things about my DD infront of me, her and his parent!!!! The parent did what they could and apologised but still...the parents are nice people and i get on with them so dont want to make it an issue - although i will be picking up with the class teacher to keep ab eye on thr behaviour towards my DD

Anyway i asked her after school if he is her friend and she said he always says horrible things and he says hes not her friend. 

How do i teach her that it is OK to not be friends with everyone? Any advice?My DD is 7 overly friendly, doesnt understand boundaries at time and can come across as overly emotional with her peers.

Dannielle Y(2),"Hi all, a little long winded but would love some advice, 
My daughter is almost 10 and in year 5.. since going back she has had a few problems, in all honesty I no what kids are like, and I also no what my daughter is like, she is far from perfect and she can give as good as she gets, however she has come home over the months with several bruises in various places and nail marks in her wrist, approached the school, they said they would keep a close eye on the situation, she was pushed over before Xmas and hit her head of the floor quite hard, since that day she begs me not to send her in, and the school have brushed it of as just kids, 
 Now however since returning last week, she has been hurt again, I approached the other parent and just asked to have a little chat, explained the situation and also explained that I've been to the school and it's ongoing and I fully understand that kids are kids and just wanted to catch it before it got worse, she called me liar called my daughter a liar (whilst pointing at her) the school hadn't spoken to her so I was therefore making it all up, I walked away.
Waited for her 2 leave and had private chat with 2 teachers, daughter basically broke down and revealed quite a lot, school now seem bothered, my dilemma is this parent helps out quite a lot in the class and daughter point blank refusing to go in..

Claire C(1995),"Hi after some advice. My son is 5 and is in reception. He has taken a while to settle in and I still worry that he hasn’t formed many friendships. He likes school and is very well behaved, doesn’t like to break rules but seems to spend a lot of time alone at break time. He has had a couple of incidents in the playground with older children that I reported to the school and was told it had been dealt with. Tonight he told me that a boy in year 1 and a girl in year 4 got him at break time and said put your finger in your nose or we ll do It, poke your eye or we ll do it, put your hands around your neck or we ll do it etc. Initially he said he was with another boy from his class, I think this is because he is starting to feel embarrassed about being on his own. But then he said he was alone and let them do it. I am devastated. I have tried to give him the tools to be confident and stand up for himself and just can’t get over how vile some children are. I don’t know if I’m over reacting and it’s just kids being kids but the thought of it breaks me. I was going to speak to his teacher tomorrow but not sure if to go the head but also feel like I’m turning into one of those complaining mums. Help

Kelly N(283),"Hi. This is something thats happening to my bestfriend, not me. She is a young single mother of 4, after fleeing donestic abuse. so I am a very active part of her childrens lives. Her 3rd child is being seen by CAMS as he has shown traits of behaviour issues, possible PTSD after witnessing horrible things regarding his father, who my friend has now removed from his life, for his own wellbeing. His father is an awful person. Anyway, he is a lovely boy but not the best behaved. He is in trouble at school quite often but my girl has got staight onto it and got him help. He also IS punished for bad behaviour at home. Anyway today we saw on facebook that a mother of a child in his class has posted a status saying that he has been bullying her child. Ofc not acceptable. However ahe has said that she has not spoken to the morher as there is Ã¢Â€Âœno pointÃ¢Â€Â she has named this child, full name and stated his school, publicly. Said he is a known troubled child, comes from a rough family, and that she is going to loose his temper with him if her child is approached again. We are so upset as all it took was for her to approach one of us in playground and he would have been dealt with accordingly. To publicly name a 4 year old child on facebooj and **** him off? To call him a well known problemed child, surely this is a hate crime? As she knows he is under CAMS. Im just wondering where I stand on this legally. What rules/laws has she broken? To name a 4 year old who is currently in the process of being under child protection laws due to his father. This must be illegal? There is a thread of comments talking about him being excluded and having mental health issues and how he needs to be kept away from other kids. And sayinf his family are Ã¢Â€ÂœpikeyÃ¢Â€Â and rough, which they are not. This is heartbreaking to see my little nephew slandered like this online. He is alovely boy but he has been acting out due to recent trauma &amp; it is being dealt with. Pls somebody advise me further. What rules/regulations are being broken here? As its on facebook the school dont want to know. But she has named &amp; shamed a mentally ill 4 year old. Please help. XoHi. This is something thats happening to my bestfriend, not me.

Jo W(979),"Dd (primary age) has been best friends with a girl since they were 5. When they first became friends dd wasn't eating her dinners at school, school told me that they caught her 'friend' telling her what she could and couldn't eat, and she was told off for doing so. 
Fast forward 5 years and this kind of thing is continuing. I've spoke to the child's mum and have even been to the school. It seems that her being told helps, but only for a number of days. 
My dd basically has to do as her friend says or they can't be friends anymore. My dd is so frightened of her, and doesnt want to loose her as a friend. 
I've told dd when this starts she needs to stop playing with her friend and play with somebody else, but she said they all play as a group and will be left out.
Through the years I've tried to encourage her to play with other people, and be around people who make us happy not sad. But sjnce finding new friends she seems to now be getting grief for this. 
During the navity dd cried 80℅ of the time. I thought it was nerves but after she told me her friend had been nasty to her right before heading in to the show! I told her to speak to her teacher, and again its been sorted and their friends again but I've told her if this carriers on she will not be playing with her fullstop!! 
I've tried to encourage her to stick her for herself, be the better person ect ect but after 5 years of being the better person she just seems to becoming a victim!

Ashleigh B(128),"I have a 10yo son who has Dyspraxia and he really struggles with his emotions, he is friendly outgoing and very funny! he has a group of friends who are all that little bit older and more mature (my son is one of the youngest in his year) but he is always on the outside! For years he has always been the one they wind up or the butt of the jokes or the one left out (We live in the country 7 miles out from the school village so sometimes that’s just how it is)I’ve spoken to some of the other mums about it and they always seem to be understanding and I explain that my son interprets things differently etc but now he is in his last year of primary it’s becoming a lot harder to deal with. Nothing my son does is right, he can’t win. This morning he was punched by one lad, I don’t know the ins and outs of it all but the school senco called me today to say she was really worried about him and his self esteem is at an all time low! My heart is breaking for him! I just wish I knew how to fix it for him! Secondary school is just around the corner and I don’t know how he will cope!

mummytoato​ddler,"Ok, I'll keep this as short as possible...

I got with my babys father 4 years ago. We get together and I love in almost a month after being together. Everything goes great, then 6months down the line, we argue and the relationship ends. Couple of weeks later I find out I'm pregnant. So I tell him the day after and he tells me to &#034;sort it out cos I want nothing to do with it&#034;. I tell him straight &#034;F You I'll do it myself&#034;. 

I get a message from him 2 weeks later and he asks what I'm going to do about it. So again, i tell him, I'm keeping it (I'm against abortion). My auntie tells me to be the bigger person and tell him when all my appointments are and if he wants to be there then great, if not, great. So that's what i did.

20 weeks scan and I find out I'm having a baby girl (absolutely overjoyed!). I tell him and send a pic of the scan pic and he replies &#034;omg that's beautiful&#034;. At that point I think he's coming round so i offer to send him a scan photo. Couple of weeks later, i find out he's been going around telling people that the baby isn't his. So I go to his to demand the scan photo back and he tells he he doesn't have it anymore and that it's in the bin! Blocked him on everything after that.

Anyway.. in the month of March my baby girl was born (had a traumatic labour). When my GG(gorgeous girl) was 11 months old, i get into a new relationship (partner took her on without a second thought!) and 2 years after that it ends. When my GG was 15months old, baby daddy decides to &#034;do the right thing&#034; and be involved and he apologies for everything. I give him a chance and couple of weeks later he tells me he wants me back, cares about me so much it hurts etc. I told him straight, that we will never be together again. 

He accepts that and sees her once a week on a regular basis and now that I'm single again, he starts messaging me all that again and when I tell him to stop because it makes me uncomfortable and he starts saying &#034;You got a new partner again have you&#034;. I ignore it but he did this before and I feel very threatened again. My question is, what do i do?? I have anxiety, PTSD and depression. Any advice would be great. Thanks.

zippadeedo​oda,"My 8 year old son told me last night that he was punched in the head by a girl in his class. It happened at the after school club. I asked him what happened and he said he was colouring in and she just came over and punched him four times on the forehead really hard (he demonstrated to me and they were hard punches). He said he told one of the supervisors and she was put on time out for 5 minutes. He was really upset about it last night and was complaining of a headache which obviously worried me. The girl in question quite often hits other classmates and swears quite frequently. She has been diagnosed with ASD so I'm not sure if this is a characteristic of this disorder? Do you think the school. 

Do you think the school should have told me?

Anon (2551508),"Hi all looking for a bit of advice on how to deal with another child and her mum, this child I’ll call her Alice, alice bullied my dd for nearly a year until the school eventually moved Alice to the other p6 class. 

During the year of constant problems with Alice, anytime she saw my dd and me (small town) she would continually shout my dds name, while Alice’s mum would make threatening comments about me allowing my dd to ignore hers, telling her dd were just nasty people she’s gonna deal with us.

Since Alice has been moved to another class thing have improved greatly for my dd, however Alice’s mum has become a big problem.

 She hangs around the school gate with her friend in the morning and makes insults as I pass, she joined the gym class I was at.... I quit. She writes daily on Facebook about how her dd is bullied by me and my dd, also ******** the way I dressed that day, updates her Facebook buddies about where I am etc. 

I have only ever went to the school and once the police to sort problems with her and her dd as she’s not at all approachable. When I went to the police after she threatened me in the playground and followed me all the way home (I had 4 children with me) has woman is huge!

Other than our children falling out and her dd bullying mine, there doesn’t seem to be a real reason for her behaviour. 

When I went to the police they went to take a statement and warned her about her behaviour but because the Facebook comments don’t say my name or dds nothing was really done.

She started sending her dd to the community centre my children were at when I moved them to another after school her dd joined just 3 weeks later.

This is just a small amount of the things that happened, so although things have settled for my dd in school hours. I’m seriously worried this woman will not stop and worry walking home alone with dd.

Since her dd moved class I’ve seen her shout and scream at another parent who approached her about her dds behaviour. But her main focus is me. 

Any advice would be appreciated xHi all looking for a bit of advice on how to deal with another child and her mum, this child I’ll call her Alice, alice bullied my dd for nearly a year until the school eventually moved Alice to the other p6 class.

Karina M(61),"So if you met my 2.5 year old, you would think he is adorable. He could talk in proper sentences before he was 2, is very bright and has an outstanding memory. In adult and older children's company, we have no problems what so ever. But he is a little devil the way he scratches and lashes out at little ones (his own age and younger), and usually on their face, and often for no reason at all. At nursery we have 3 or 4 times a days when he scratches. Now we are not just talking fighting over toys, or usual squabbles. In some instances he singles a young child out to injure. He fully understands what he is doing, even talking us through it. &#034;I'm gonna scratch the green (coat) boy because he is naughty&#034;. And at the end of nursery he can give us a full run down of the events. He knows it is wrong, but we have no idea why he is doing it. This has gone way past simple frustration. He never touches older children and is very happy in their company. He has been moved up a group at nursery, but the classes often mix. We have been embarrassed to be told he can not be left alone when in these mixed group situations. We do time outs, missing out on treats, no TV, taking away from the situation. We tried to reason with him, but he just seems to enjoy the discussions, so limit this as we don't want him to think he is getting extra attention by scratching. I do not believe he has ADHD or anything that may trigger aggression. I really do not know what to do. If he just hit everyone, that would probably be easier to deal with. Anyone experienced anything similar? Any suggestion what to do? The heath visitor says we are doing everything right, but I am getting worried he is going to have to leave nursery. It has been 6 months this has been going on.So if you met my 2.5 year old, you would think he is adorable.

Heather H(476),Hi. I'm just looking some advice and or help. My of has just started P1 and for the last week she has been coming home and telling me that another boy is hitting her. I have addressed it with the P1 teacher and was told he's such a nice wee boy. He wouldn't do a thing like that. That happened last week. It came to a head again in Wednesday when she point blank refused to get ready for school. So much so that I actually sat on my stairs and cried. I eventually got her ready and went to school. The bell went for her to go in and she started to cry which made me cry. I was in a state. The P1 teacher took us in and tried to call us down and said it's just cos my of was tired. She came home from school and told me that the boy had ripped her pom poms off her schoolbag. I had enough. So this morning the bell went and the P1 teacher had to peel her off me. Meanwhile the boy had lined up beside her and I turned to him and said stay away from my daughter. The mother overhead this and confronted me outside school. I told her I had cos her son was assaulting my lg. She said why hadn't she been spoken to. I said I didn't know and she went into the school. I then got a phone call from the head telling me that I had verbally abused a child. I told her they left me no option cos they weren't doing anything. So I got told off like a child and I've been really sick ever since cos she basically told me I was wrong. My husband and friends say I'm not cos the school wouldn't do anything. Something is bothering her when she loved school at the start and now she won't even go. I spoke to the health visitor and she said the school had been very unprofessional about it all. What do I do now?

Michelle H(2009),Hiya. I just wanted some opinions on what happened with this guy basically. Been chatting for a few weeks (swapped numbers after matching on a dating site) we made arrangements in the week to meet up last night. He booked a table for drinks somewhere for 8. We had been chatting about it all week and he seemed excited. Anyway the day comes and he messages just like normal. Saying he's at work etc. And I start getting ready quite early as I don't want to be rushing. He finishes work at 6 and he messages but he's just banging on about how tired he is and how works f*****d him up. So I'm kinda annoyed by this I mean the last thing I wanna hear is that it just makes it sound like you can't be bothered now. So I say to are you too tired to meet its okay if you are (I'd be annoyed but don't want him to know that) he says it's up to me lol like that helps. Anyway after going back and forth he says he wants to see me and he can be ready by 9. I am relived as just spent 3 hours getting ready but bit annoying to have to wait. He says he's going to eat then get ready etc and he'll see me at the place at 9. Anyway half 8 comes and I leave my house thinking I will arrive a little early. So I leave and arrive at the place around quarter to and I wait. Next thing he messages at 9 saying what you doing? I say what do you mean. He's like I just had my Chinese sitting down and I'm stuffed. I said are you coming out then or not and he's like I just gotta do my teeth get ready etc and at this point I'm so mad I say let's just leave it you're being so long. He would be atleast another half hour cause of where he lives and getting there. At this point I feel like hes dragging himself out I mean he couldnt seem more half ***** about it if he tried. He's like sorry I'm just being slow work was so bad etc. I didn't tell him I was at the place cause I was so embarrassed. It just seemed like he couldn't be bothered at all. I felt like such an idiot sitting there. In the end I text and Said what are you doing then and he was like whattt I thought you were staying in make your mind up. I was thinking I'm not the one who's not stuck to the plans. I then txt and said yeah I'm going home I already left and I've heard nothing since. I guess I just need to vent really. Time is so precious even more so as a single mum and my whole Saturday was wasted I even went shopping in the day for new shoes lol I feel like such a **** and he seemed to not get it at all.

He says he's going to eat then get ready etc and he'll see me at the place at 9. Anyway half 8 comes and I leave my house thinking I will arrive a little early. So I leave and arrive at the place around quarter to and I wait. Next thing he messages at 9 saying what you doing? I say what do you mean. He's like I just had my Chinese sitting down and I'm stuffed. I said are you coming out then or not and he's like I just gotta do my teeth get ready etc and at this point I'm so mad I say let's just leave it you're being so long. He would be atleast another half hour cause of where he lives and getting there. At this point I feel like hes dragging himself out I mean he couldnt seem more half ***** about it if he tried. He's like sorry I'm just being slow work was so bad etc. I didn't tell him I was at the place cause I was so embarrassed. It just seemed like he couldn't be bothered at all. I felt like such an idiot sitting there. In the end I text and Said what are you doing then and he was like whattt I thought you were staying in make your mind up. I was thinking I'm not the one who's not stuck to the plans. I then txt and said yeah I'm going home I already left and I've heard nothing since. I guess I just need to vent really. Time is so precious and my whole Saturday was wasted I even went shopping in the day for new shoes lol I feel like such a **** and he seemed to not get it at all. Am I right to be cross at this guy. What would you do now if it was you?,3,941, 30-09-2018 at 10.40AM

Miranda E(9),"So in Y4 my daughter has this boy who physically and verbally bullied her every day. I have records of 23 times when I went in to school to tell them about it. School obviously were rubbish at dealing with it despite their brilliant on paper anti bullying policy. They did eventually put measures in place in the last 3 weeks of term (mainly because I said if they didn't stop the bullying she wouldn't be going back).
Last year (Y5)they were put in different classes and things with this boy settled down. Now I thought this boy had left the school but apparently that was only for a while so he's coming back September. One of my friends who knows his mum has told me he's going to be in the same class as my daughter (she told me today about half an hour ago). Why on earth would they do that? There are 3 Y6 classes, there was no need for them to be together. 
My daughter HATE school since this boy bullied her and I don't know what to do. I don't even know if I should tell her so she's prepared but then she'll only worried.
I have emailed the school but obviously they are on holiday, although they may be in Monday as it's an inset day. Should I ring Monday? Should I just let it go and hope this boy's grown up? Do you think I should tell my daughter?

Jorge V,"hello i have a 2 year old son and 5 year old stepson. The 5 year old stepson humiliates the 2 year old son by calling him a brat and saying his brother dies. The 5 year old stepson tells the 2 year old son that his toys are worse and uglier than his own toys. I have a question regarding how to go about the 5 year olds behaviour towards the 2 year old. 

On one hand my instinct tells me to acknowledge the 5 year olds behavior towards the 2 year old and call him out on it by telling the 5 year old to stop the name calling and humiliation of the 2 year old as simply ignoring the name calling could have subconscious negative effects on the 2 year olds emotional and mental wellbeing .


 On the other hand there is another approach to the situation which dictates to not acknowledge the 5 years old humiliation and name calling towards the 2 year old for the purpose that not acknowledging and ignoring the 5 year olds humiliation and name calling towards the 2 year old teaches the 2 year old to not place importance on the name calling for the sake of the 2 year olds mental and emotional wellbeing, though I wonder whether this approach would have a positive or negative subonscious effect on the 2 year olds emotional and mental wellbeing, if it has a subconscious effect at all. 

Which approach is best for the 2 year olds mental and emotional wellbeing?

Kate J(478),"Hi,

I've just moved my 9 year old schools. He's always had issues with one particular child and school have dismissed it as my son being sensitive. But the last 12 months this child has really upped the ante. To a point where my son was needing me in bed to fall asleep, crying at the smallest thing(home and school) and given up all his after school activities as this child has said he will continue it there. School are still saying they haven't seen anything.

He's suffered lots of small things such as being called stupid ,told to shut up every time he spoke and the kid saying he wants to be friends and then humiliating him confront of others. I say small, when carried out frequently it's become a huge problem for my sons emotional well being. It was such a small school so most friendships are forced and no one defended him.

I'm so heartbroken and sorry I didn't step in sooner and put too much trust in the school and ignored my intuition. I've really let him down. He's such a lovely kind natured boy and he didn't deserve any of this.

Moving forward, my head is mush at the minute and emotions and anxiety are high, how can I help rebuild my child's confidence?Hi,I've just moved my 9 year old schools.  He's always had issues with one particular child and school have dismissed it as my son being sensitive.  But the last 12 months this child has really upped the ante.  To a point where my son was needing me in bed to fall asleep, crying at the smallest thing(home and school) and given up all his after school activities as this child has said he will continue it there.  School are still saying they haven't seen anything.He's suffered lots of small things such as being called stupid ,told to shut up every time he spoke and the kid saying he wants to be friends and then humiliating him confront of others.   I say small, when carried out frequently it's become a huge problem for my sons emotional well being.  It was such a small school so most friendships are forced and no one defended him.I'm so heartbroken and sorry I didn't step in sooner and put too much trust in the school and ignored my intuition.

J L(84),"Hi, not sure if this is the correct place to get opinions and advice about an incident that happened at my daughter's pre-school.

My DD is 3yrs old and told me that a boy (not sure what his name is) had kicked her in her face.

I informed the school and they said they will keep an eye on my DD. They did tell me that my DD told her keyworker that her face hurt and was crying but they didn't see the incident take place. But, they only told me this because I was bringing to their attention a small bruise and cut under her eye where my daughter told me that some children were trying to take her alice band and that is how she hurt her eye.

Can someone tell me if I did the right thing or if I have missed out anything to ensure the safety of my daughter? I know that kids will have fights etc in school but I just want to get your advice on what you would do? I feel that I have done as much as I can do and have told them to keep an eye on my daughter and informed the headmistress of this incident.

Thanks in advance :)

Jennifer T(212),"They are six but this has been going since reception and nothing seems to be changing. Last year it was mainly name-calling but since starting this term he's escalated to throwing rocks and water bottles at her. He is autistic with ADHD so the school are doing very little other than tellingy DD to stay away from him. 

Last year she was in trouble a lot for being loud and very physical in her play, she really calmed down as the year went on to the point of getting a head teacher award at the end of the year. She is hard work but as she doesn't have any medical issues I get full wack of telling off etc. 

According to his mum he acts like this because he said &#034;I do it coz I a love her and will marry her when I'm older&#034; ... She does nothing to stop him and actively encourages him to give her sweets etc. Her teacher has told me they are telling her to stay away from him but he follows her around ALL the time so she can't get a break. At least they listened when I asked for them to be in different classes...

Basically I think he's fixated on her and its his way of dealing with it but should I be pressuring the school to try something else as what they're doing isn't working? Or should I talk directly to the head and complain?

Patricia C(233),"I wonder if any one can give me some advice. My daughter is 9 1/2. Yesterday My daughter was out playing in school ground behind our house with friends. I kept checking on her. These two girls who are 8 years old and twins who she is normally very friendly with came over to my daughter pushed her to ground and started kicking her in her privates. I did not see it happen, as quickly went inside to check on my youngest son, but heard screaming so ran back out of back door in to garden to see what was going on. I saw her getting up off floor crying so her Oldest brother ran around and got her and bought her home.

She is complaining of some pain in her privates and says it hurts abit if she goes to toilet. There is no bruising though. I have a Dr appointment for her in morning as they were full today.

I have not been round to talk to the girl's parents yet as they are not very nice people, they can be very imtimidating and agressive and I'm worried it will be there word against Ares. There daughters will probably lie and they will believe them. 

How do I deal with this, I won't be letting my daughter play on school ground by her self again. She does not want to any way, she is too scared now. There were 2 other girls there who are good friends with my daughter, who saw every thing. 

Should I say any thing or just leave it. What would you do if it had happened to your child.

Kas W(3),"Hi
I have a daughter age 7. 
Several months ago she came home in a state crying. Another girl in her class has been bullying her, mainly verbal abuse but there has also been some physical. 
This has included excluding her from the lunch table where her other friends sit, bending back her fingers and calling her names (she cries and that makes the little girl laugh). This also includes swearing.

I addressed this immediately (after a weekend with my child having nightmares and for the first time saying she doesn’t want to go to school) with the Teacher and the other child apologised. I was also informed that the parents were made aware of the situation.The situation calmed down, but shortly after it resumed with verbal abuse.
Pointing and laughing, saying she is a cry baby and stupid. 

The school have been good in the sense that they have addressed my concerns. They have done plays in class about how to treat people . I believe it’s learnt behaviour. I have had umpteen meetings, and given my child tools to develop resilience. They decided that both children should be given a wide birth, and monitored the situation. 
Just before the summer holidays my daughter was excluded from the lunch hall table but this other little girl. All her friends were sitting there and she went away. She told me she felt so alone, and didn’t know what to do. I really felt upset inside knowing how hurt she must have felt. Upon approaching the teacher she confirmed this was because they’ve been told to have space. However, I stated that this doesn’t mean that she should be excluded from a table where her friends are already sitting. What gives the child or anyone for that matter the right to dictate where she should sit? I wouldn’t expect that behaviour from my child let alone another.

My daughter has changed significantly.
At home she is happy and confident. However, at school she has become withdrawn with a regular sad face. She is nervous at the prospect of resuming school, and whilst I am not expressing this to her; I am not overly excited about her return.

The school agreed that there would be a fresh start after summer. They have said they will monitor it and come to them with any concerns. How do I make this better for my child?

I did approach the Dad when the situation was extreme in a friendly way. He didn’t believe what I was saying but also stated he didn’t think my daughter was lying.

The school is brilliant. She used to literally skip to school with a joy in her heart. Now that’s gone.

A month before they broke up the situation calmed down slightly with the little girl, but now she’s encouraging another girl to pick on my child. This other little girl was good friends with my child. Now she’s started abusing my daughter seeing her as an easy target because she is seen as soft. I get on well with the Mum, but won’t approach as it didn’t previously get the result I wanted (I don’t however regret approaching the Dad because at least it made him aware).


My daughter won’t defend herself. She’s taught to do so in karate but she won’t hit back. I also believe hitting back will make it worse. I’ve asked her to try ignoring them both . Not give them a reaction.


She has other friends and they’ve been supportive. She does after school clubs to build up her confidence again including karate.


I don’t know if I’ve made much sense,but I am beside myself with concern. I know that my daughter will face these challenges including the typical “ I’m not your friend anymore”; but how do I make this better? How do I erase the bad memories from her previous bullying before the summer holidays? She’s now become upset/frustrated over petty little things instead of letting it go l; as a result of the bullying .

I’m really interested in hearing from parents (and even teachers) in similar situations who used different strategies that worked. I’m interested in moving forward .
She doesn’t want to change schools /class or have Home schooling, so it’s really about other tools that have worked in your experience. 

I’ve also encouraged her to make new friends.

Thanks so much for reading this.
Really keen to get your responses.

Marie J(210),"Good Afternoon Everyone, 

I'm here today because I am besides myself with worry. 

My Daugter who is now 13 and going into Year 9 has been bullied on and off through her s starting her secondary school.
I have been down the school so many times I can't even count them. It gets resolved for a short while and then continues. 

My daughter started self harming by cutting her wrists multiple times. I took her to the doctors who sent her to counselling which didn't really help. The school knows all this but the bullying still continued. I couldn't take anymore so told the school I was withdrawing my daughter from the school and home schooling. I'm uneducated myself so was scared that my daughter wouldn't learn as much as she could and probably wouldn't get through her GCSEs in a couple of years with my guidance :( The school started to listen and didnt want my daughter removed from the school and agreed to a manage move to another school in Birmingham. My daughter really wanted to go to this one secondary school that all her primary school friends attend but the teachers suggested she go to a school she knows noone to have a fresh start. So trusting them my daughter agreed. She started the new secondary school and some girls there started on her about her name saying its a black name and started verbally abusing her that resulted in my daughter ending her manage move and going back to her original school where she was originally bullied. A few months past and I thought things were ok until I seen my daughter sitting at the top of the stairs crying her eyes out telling me she cant cope anyone and wants to die. I took her straight back to the doctors where they put her on antidepressants and took her straight back off them a few weeks ago as she were too young to be prescribed them the doctor also signed her off school for about two weeks and then the six weeks holiday started. We were supposed to move so I havent even thought about her going back to that school but that move fell through as a family member was diagnosed with cancer.

Ive cried so much this week ringing Local Authority, Bullying charitys etc to get advice on how to educate my daughter or get her into another school as shes refusing to return to her old secondary school shes registered to but noone had any help and said I need to go back to the school for some help Im scared they wont help as they managed moved my daughter and it failed 

I really dont know what to do and Im not smart enough to home educate I wouldnt know where to start :( 

Thank you for listening xGood Afternoon Everyone, I'm here today because I am besides myself with worry. My Daugter who is now 13 and going into Year 9 has been bullied on and off through her s starting her secondary school.I have been down the school so many times I can't even count them. It gets resolved for a short while and then continues. My daughter started self harming by cutting her wrists multiple times. I took her to the doctors who sent her to counselling which didn't really help. The school knows all this but the bullying still continued. I couldn't take anymore so told the school I was withdrawing my daughter from the school and home schooling. I'm uneducated myself so was scared that my daughter wouldn't learn as much as she could and probably wouldn't get through her GCSEs in a couple of years with my guidance  The school started to listen and didnt want my daughter removed from the school and agreed to a manage move to another school in Birmingham. My daughter really wanted to go to this one secondary school that all her primary school friends attend but the teachers suggested she go to a school she knows noone to have a fresh start. So trusting them my daughter agreed. She started the new secondary school and some girls there started on her about her name saying its a black name and started verbally abusing her that resulted in my daughter ending her manage move and going back to her original school where she was originally bullied. A few months past and I thought things were ok until I seen my daughter sitting at the top of the stairs crying her eyes out telling me she cant cope anyone and wants to die.

Donna G(444),"My 7yr old has been victimised, bullied and harassed by ‘some’ of her peers for months.

Stopped her from leaving and going home, screamed obscenities in her face, took her things refusing to give them back and throwing them at her when they've seen me coming.

Stephanie A(235),My son is 9. He's quite small for his age but the sweetest boy you could meet. He's struggled a lot through school with being the smallest and the youngest and has survived to year 5. The latest thing to occur though has left me heartbroken and upset that there is nothing that can be done. A classmate of his mother told her son that he was not allowed to our house because I am a cow - never done anything to this woman to warrant this - complete shock that any mother would say that to a 9 year old in the first place. But now my child is being picked on and bullied because of this. I've spoke to the school and after some ridiculous nonchalant emails from them I spoke to the councillor who said she would sit the boys down and sort it out. But how do I prevent this happening again. How do you stop a child's mother being the cause of the bullying.My son is 9. He's quite small for his age but the sweetest boy you could meet.

Ernestine B,"Hi

I am a newbie on here!! Feel a bit anxious to be honest!

What I am wanting from my post is some guidance to want to do in the situation I find myself in with my child!

My child is in secondary school and is being bullied! School dealt with the situation by separating the pair of them, they were both in most lessons together! So my daughter had to change classes! My child saw this as a punishment, the my child lanyard colour was changed as they both had the same colour.. Again my child saw this as an another punishment! With all the support from me, it wasn't enough! 

My child was groomed, mentally physically and sexually assaulted! School put it down to children just experimenting with their sexuality, it was the norm! Not when my child said NO to being sexually assaulted! My child showed a teacher the bruises , that the bully had done, big black/purple bruises, and the mental cruelty was just awful! School made the bully the victim, and my child made to feel that they weren't believed! LEA was brought in and I was made to feel I was making something out of nothing! 

In PE they wont separated the pair, the school emailed me to say that they dont have to do anything, as in keep them separated as the bully hasn't been charged! What about my child's well being, and safe guarding? Where is the duty of care?
Just lately the bully shouted to my child, they needed to be pinned to the wall and shot dead! Because my child is hated! The bully even agreed when questioned about the threat, they had indeed said it, when questioned by the head teacher! I called the police, they went into school, and hey ho school fed them a **** and bull story, and nothing been done!

I have gone down every avenue to have this sort of bullying stopped! School again and the LEA seem to think its a right of passage to adulthood! 

Has anyone actually managed to get themselves heard, and the bully be charged or excluded permanently? 

I know in schools bullying is wide spread! So why isn't something done about it? Instead of turning a blind eye!

My child is now with CAMHS because not wanting to have been born! Also has suicidal thoughts! CAMHS believes my child, but are powerless to do anything, except try and sort the mental health problems out, plus the self harming, and dark thoughts.. 

I am not to good on m literacy! apologises..


Any guidance grateful received! Thank you in Advance!

So my son today who is 5 years old was walking down with his friend that lives down the road. 
Another friend came out of his house and said hey poo poo head.. witch to fair he says that to his other friend. And they say it back 
I was trying to get into the school and drop my son off when the mum pulled me aside. 
And said my son was quite upset about what your son said.. I was quite flustered to be honest. I was trying to get my son in the door before it shut..
I said to my son you shouldn’t be saying those words it’s not very nice she got too his level and said “do you want to have friends?” “Then stop saying mean words” and walked off? I have to do the school run later. 

And I will say sorry to parent and explain he will be punished. But I’m still nervous.. any advice in what to say?

Kath G(17),"I'm good at fixing things but I don't know how to fix this, I'm stuck.

My son, age 12, has a Youtube channel where he makes game videos, just fun stuff nothing weird. Sometimes he might do a vlog.
On one of his short vlogs he has had some serious racist remarks left about him and also includes a message, on Youtube, to my son telling him me, his mum, is going to be raped. Youtube are aware as these remarks have been reported to Youtube.
I have very good reason to believe that it is children from his school leaving these comments. School is aware as it overflows into his school life.

Now my son really enjoyed making gaming vids on youtube but since he has had these comments left it has really knocked him, his spark has gone and I don't know how to get it back and I feel helpless. Does anyone have any ideas on how to get his spark back please?
We cannot remove the comments as they need to be there for evidence so the police can trace the people who have written these comments, right back to their home address.

I wish I had a magic wand.

My son is one of those nice kids that you come across in life. Never had a school report that wasn't glowing, never been called into school for his behaviour.

becky p(98),hi parents new to this my daughter is in yr 3 (8) and currently she is being bullied (i think) at her school by a child with special needs. Ive spoken to the school but i always get the same reaction that he doesnt understand or thats just what he does... hes been stabbing her in her arms with pencils n been slapping her. Of late i thought we had dealt with it but last couple of days hes stopped hitting her and has now taken to verbally bullying her or screaming in her ears which she finds very hurtful as we think she has hyper sensitive hearing (even blew a recorder in her ear . she also has her own needs as she suffers from tremors in her body. The school just seem to be turning a blind eye to his behavior and im now concerned as my daughter is obsessing over this bully and having nightmares and the other thing that makes it very hard is that the mum is always either helping in the classroom or she is hanging over the teacher. Shes also best friends with alot of the members of staff at the school including the sen co. When i tell the TAs of a few teachers they also then turn n say well hes not only attacking her he does it to every child or they make out that my daughter is lying. Any advice or anyone in the same circle at school or its who you know not what you know... or do you think im over reacting as its my kid n im just being too protective ??????? thanks in advancehi parents new to this my daughter is in yr 3 (8) and currently she is being bullied (i think) at her school by a child with special needs.

Anon (2529826),"Hi there I'm looking for a wee bit of advice. This may be a long post but I'll try to make it as short as possible.
Since January my dd has been getting hassled both in + out of school. It has got to a stage now I'm thinking of moving her school.
The incident which started it as far as I can gather was re Snapchat! Myself + the mother spoke about this, although she has a slightly different version of events to me. I won't get into that. Since then there has been numerous incidents both in + out of school.
I have approached the school so many times re the incidents at school these are not physical, mostly waiting at the gates + doors for dd following her around calling her names. The school are apparently surprised at these incidents even though dd is reporting them at the time. The school informed us of disgusting things being spread over social media about my dd, we can't see these as my dd is not on any of these apps. The head asked us not to approach the parents + leave it to him as this girls father is gravely ill + the ringleader may be acting out because of this. Stupidly we agreed to this. No change in how dd was treated at school by this crowd. Approached the school again + told her I understand such + such is ill but this is no excuse for the months of abuse my dd has had to put up with + I want it sorted. Meanwhile in the background my husband + I were dealing with mum about the incidents outwith school. 
Anyway got to a point dd was physically attacked outwith school by the ring leader + 1 of her minions. They had her on the ground kicking her while she was down. They approached her from the back so she had no chance to defend herself. When we got the call from another parent my husband went to get her. He went to the door of 1 of the girls + the mum wanted him to speak to the girls about it. He refused to speak to children + spoke to her. On way home he met the other mum who at that point had no knowledge of this so he explained situation + she assured him it would be dealt with took his number + agreed to contact him when she spoke to the girl. Later in the day he went to a friend's house to find these two mums at the friends door(friends daughter is also Friends with my children) complaining about my child + husband. According to them he was shouting swearing + intimidating these women. Husband ignored them + went on doing what he was doing. 
I made the school aware of what happened, I know they can't deal with issues outwith but I wanted them to be aware it had turned physical. Told dd to stay away from them, report any incidents + might not be everyone's way but if they hit her hit back. She's not used that yet though. 
I was talking to a friend about this + all the other incidents. She mentioned it to someone else they went back to the real dad + she received a message which was forwarded to me. This message stated my dd was the bully, I use my dd autism as an excuse + we as parents stand at the school to intimidate this girl! 
I certainly do not! I would never knowingly allow my child to make another child feel like ****! My oldest was bullied all through his school years + I most certainly would not wish that on anyone! One of us have picked our children up from school since they started school. We don't live near school so have to, we are adults + have never approached these children. When husband collects them he stays in car. I go to gates cos I don't drive. Anyway I contacted the police for advice re the attack. They visited + I told them everything. They explained it is difficult to deal with these incidents as they would go to other house + they'd make counter allegations. I understand this. Told them I just want it to stop, I don't want to charge children, so it was warnings all round. Including my daughter. This was accepted all round. 
The ringleader is not only doing this to dd she's doing it to others too. 
I'm starting to go on a bit. So long story short this is still happening. They have not physically attacked her again but the verbal abuse is still going on.
I got a knock on the door last night, another parent to tell me her dd is having issues with the ringleader also but when the mother was approached she blamed my dd. 
My dd was not there during the last 3 incidents! She says this mother was brandishing accusations about re my husband too.
 There are witnesses to all these incidents + yet no one is listening. My daughter agreed to mediation with ringleader + it came out that there are 18 other children involved in tormenting my daughter!! 
Now I know every parent likes to think not my child but I can assure you that I would never let my child bully another, autism or no autism! Oh + the only way her parents could have found out about autism is if the school told them, only the people who need to know know this + yes mine has answered back. I do not expect her to be cowed by them! 
My dd is a mess, she can't sleep + when she does she has nightmares about them drowning her, she has anxiety attacks + is in a state most days going to school. 
We've changed the times she does classes + stuff outwith school so she has less chance of running into this crowd. 
So my question would be what do I do next?
I have this morning spoken again to school re incidents which happened in school yesterday + arranged meeting with 2 other schools with the possibility of moving her.Hi there I'm looking for a wee bit of advice. This may be a long post but I'll try to make it as short as possible.Since January my dd has been getting hassled both in + out of school. It has got to a stage now I'm thinking of moving her school.The incident which started it as far as I can gather was re Snapchat! Myself + the mother spoke about this, although she has a slightly different version of events to me. I won't get into that. Since then there has been numerous incidents both in + out of school.I have approached the school so many times re the incidents at school these are not physical, mostly waiting at the gates + doors for dd following her around calling her names. The school are apparently surprised at these incidents even though dd is reporting them at the time. The school informed us of disgusting things being spread over social media about my dd, we can't see these as my dd is not on any of these apps. The head asked us not to approach the parents + leave it to him as this girls father is gravely ill + the ringleader may be acting out because of this. Stupidly we agreed to this. No change in how dd was treated at school by this crowd. Approached the school again + told her I understand such + such is ill but this is no excuse for the months of abuse my dd has had to put up with + I want it sorted. Meanwhile in the background my husband + I were dealing with mum about the incidents outwith school. Anyway got to a point dd was physically attacked outwith school by the ring leader + 1 of her minions. They had her on the ground kicking her while she was down. They approached her from the back so she had no chance to defend herself.  When we got the call from another parent my husband went to get her.

Alexandra E(47),"My daughter has been bullied for over 10 months by former school friends (they are 13). 

Two events involving police leading to charges on one occasion and still waiting on an update for one which took place over 4months ago! Most events happen in school (or via snapchat in the beginning until they were blocked). 

The school have tried to help (Some classes have been swapped to avoid being in these girls classes and she has a place to go to eat her lunch) but I have also been given various excuses....no-one saw it happening or it didn't happen in school. I have been told she needs to toughen up by both school and my husband. There has been physical shoving &amp; tripping up but its mainly name calling, exclusion (she's lost most of her friends as they are afraid of the bullies, even her best friend has dropped her), following her in corridors, intimidation, harassment. She just walks away and tries to ignore it. 

I know when something has happened at school as she comes home and unleashes her frustration on the family - screaming and being moody and unreasonable. I know she can't help it and I know she feels we are all letting her down. She refuses to see a counsellor but does speak to her school guidance teacher. I tried to get the GP to talk to her on a recent visit but she refused to open up. 

She does have a few clubs she loves and recently started volunteer work. However one of the girls friends has started on her now at her dancing and I'm afraid she will want to not go. She's already isolated enough. 

My husband refuses to change her school and says you don't run away from bullies. I'm in two minds about the whole changing school. These girls have cousins all over the area and I don't believe they won't stop trying to get to her via other people at another school. At least this school are aware of the issues and trying to deal with some of it. And then do we have to change her clubs...where does it all end. 

She's never found it the easiest to make friends and her confidence understandably is at an all time low. The mother of the main girl involved is a scumbag and there is no point in communicating with her.My husband works away a lot and tries his best but he isn't around for the day to day ups and downs. 

If I feel it's getting me worn down I can't imagine what she feels. How do I help her? 

Today I am so tired of it all, I had little sleep last night due to an issue at school yesterday and she isn't talking to me as I got quite angry with her screaming and trying to bully her sister when she got home. She thinks I'm on her sisters side all the time and not hers. I told her why doesn't she stand up to the bullies the way she screams at us. I know it was the wrong thing to say.

How do we continue to cope with this? Do I approach the school again? What do I say that's going to make a difference?

Lucy M(256),"I have just received a call from the Deputy Headteacher at my son's school. She called to tell me that my son has been bullying another boy in his class - calling him unpleasant names, making him cry and to the point the other boy has wet himself this morning. 

The Deputy Head has spoken to my child and made it very clear that these actions are not acceptable and I fully support whatever sanction they give my son. I have always told both of my children the importance of being kind and every morning when I drop him off, I say to him, &#034;above all&#034; and he finishes with, &#034;be kind mummy&#034; so needless to say, I am feeling every emotion right now. 

My question is - how would you deal with at home? I want to reiterate what school have said and help him understand that his actions are completely unacceptable but I want to help him understand why there are unacceptable - he is only six. At home he is incredibly strong willed and I know that simply removing TV priviledges or access to a tablet for a few days will be futile - he won't connect the two events together and won't learn anything.

Leah F(81),"Hi, hoping for some advice as i have reached the end of my tether!

My eldest DD is 11 and in year 6. There is a child in her class (I'll call her S) that is making her life miserable at the moment and im hitting brick walls everywhere I turn

**SORRY THIS IS EXTREMELY LONG**

This girl S, used to go to my DDs old school. She was there in reception and year 1. She was a troublemaker from the get go and she had a lot of friendship problems. She was, back then, very manipulative and didnt like sharing friends, she caused constant issues in the friendship groups and her mum was never away from the school. She left a few weeks into year 2 and moved to a school in another town.

Never really heard much about her after that as they moved house to be closer to the school in the other town

I left my ex, moved house and my DD's started a new school in Oct 2016. My DD became close to a girl she knew from her dancing class (i'll call her A). I was really happy she had settled so quickly and was so happy there

Then about 3 months later, This girl S also moved to the current school. She was apparently being bulled at the school she had moved to in the other town

She very quickly became obsessed with my DD. It was actually bordering on stalking. She asked to sit next her all the time, if my DD was partnered up with someone else in the class for an activity S would cry and ask the teacher that they could be paired up instead, she waited for her at the gate in the morning, had lunch with her, demanded to be sat next to her on the bus (they go on a coach to swimming/the high school quite regularly) and then when they finished school she was texting and calling my DD's mobile hundreds of times a night. 

DD was getting fed up with it, but i told her that as annoying as it was, just to go with it for the time being, be nice to S, and that S had probably latched on to DD because she didnt know anyone else, but knew DD from when they were at the same school when they were little.

I thought it would sort of fizzle out when S got to know more people, but instead i noticed my DD becoming more and more withdrawn. When i tried to get to the bottom of this it came to light that S was basically dominating my DDs whole social life. She was sending her horrible text messages if she spoke to any of her other friends, telling my DD that no one actually liked her, deciding who she could and couldnt text/phone, telling her she had to have lunch with S every day and basically not speak to anyone else. Telling DD that they were now &#034;BFF's&#034; so they should only speak to each other and that when DD did things with A or spoke to A at all she was &#034;betraying&#034; S. At the weekend she was also messaging constantly, demanding to know where DD was, what she was doing and who she was with every minute of the day and then making DD face time her so she could make sure she was telling the truth about where she was or who she was with.

If DD and A were together at the weekend (which they often are) S would be messaging asking why they were together, what they were doing, how long they had been together, when A would be going home and constantly trying to face time them. Her mum would also message me asking what they were doing and could she drop S round to mine too as she was feeling left out (S still live in the other town whereas A lives 2 doors away from us). I agreed to S being dropped off a few times, but it was always hell! My DD and A play together amazingly well. They have sleepovers most weekends, but you could guarantee that within 10 minutes of S being dropped off theyre would be arguments galore or someone would be in tears so i started saying no and that we were busy when her mum text

My DDs friendship with A seemed to be a particular sticking point with S. S had befriended A and was inviting her for sleepovers and days out, then sending DD pictures with horrible messages about the fact the S and A were together without DD. 

My DD and A sat next to each other in class, and 1 week S got &#034;star of the week&#034; and got to pick out of the treasure chest. She picked out a seat swap pass which basically allows her to choose any seat in the class for a week. There was a whole string of messages from S to my DD saying she couldnt decide whether to swap seats with my DD or with A so that DD and A wouldnt be sat next to each other. DD had replied saying why not swap with (boy in the group) so DD, A and S could all sit together and S had replied with laughing faces and &#034;Why would i do that, you'll still be next to A then&#034; :(

A's mum realised what was going on, as A had been sent similar messages to DD but not on the same scale. So she put a stop to the the sleepovers etc (I was still unaware of what was happening at this point) S then started messaging my DD constantly asking to come here for sleepovers and come to our house. When DD was telling her no, S was replying with very emotionally blackmailing texts including &#034;your mum hates me&#034; &#034;What have I done?&#034; &#034;Why dont you like me?&#034; &#034;Do you like making me sad?&#034; 

My DD was scared to speak up about it all because every time she wasnt doing exactly what S wanted, exactly when S wanted her to do it, S was accusing her of bullying her and threatening to tell the teacher that DD was a bully, that she was being nasty and making S feel sad. 

When I found out about all this, I asked DD if she wanted to be friends with S and she said no, that she was only being friends with her to keep her happy, but that DD wasnt happy at all. I said that was fine, that DD was allowed to have more than 1 friend and that simply not doing what someone wants is NOT bullying. I told her that if S starts trying to tell her what to do, just tell her no and go and play with someone else. Which is exactly what DD did.

DD and A have been keeping to playing with each other and when S has been texting with her horrible messages DD has been either ignoring her or telling S to leave her alone

S clearly didnt like my DD sticking up for herself and has gone into full blown victim mode. She has tried (and is still trying) her best to to take A away from DD, she is constantly messaging DD saying that no one likes her, telling anyone who will listen to her that DD is a bully, and that DD doesnt like her anymore and is taking all her friends away from her.

Basically everything DD does or doesnt do constitutes as her bullying S

S's mother is never away from the school complaining about 1 thing and another. She has complained that S has been isolated so the seats in the class have moved so that S now sits next to A. 

I told DD to ignore S and just get on with it and play with other people. Few days later DD was pulled out of her class by the head teacher and asked what the problem was and why she was ignoring S. DD told the head that everytime she speaks to S or has anything to do with her she gets accused of bullying her, so she was ignoring her so she couldnt be accused of anything. Head teacher then told DD that ignoring her was also a form of bullying!!! and she had to be nice to S

I was fuming and went up to the school. The class teacher said that she can see exactly whats going on, but S's mum always bypasses the class teacher and goes straight to the head. The head for some reason thinks the sun shines out of S's backside and listens to everything her mother says, then over rules the class teacher. 

S pushed DD out of the class line the other day, DD fell on the floor. But it was DD that got shouted at by the head for misbehaving, when it was actually S shoving her that caused her to fall 

I have spoken to S's mum twice now and gotten nowhere as she just denies there is a problem and says she has never been at the school about my DD (which i know for a fact is lies), but im being told from other people that she is telling other people that S is being bullied at school again by my DD!!

On Thursday when the school broke up. DD was walking out of the playground with my nephew (same class), S came up behind them and butted into their conversation. They both ignored her and S grabbed DD, smirked at her and said &#034;youre not allowed to ignore me remember&#034; aaaahh!! 

S is still messaging my DD. Just today she has sent her a screen shot showing a 2 hour facetime call, but has cropped off who the call was too. She sent it to DD and said that the face time call had been between S and A and that A doesnt actually like my DD and that A had spent 2 hours basically sla@@ing my DD of to S. Unbeknown to S, A has been with DD all weekend, and has been at my house all day and not on facetime to S at all!! 

Im sick of it! DD blocked S's number, but that was another thing S and her mother used to accuse DD of bullying and isolating S. So DD panicked and unblocked her. 

I dont know what to do. Ive gone to the head a few times,shown her screenshots of the texts S sends but she isnt interested. She says the texts are not her concern as they are outwith school (which i do get) but the bigger picture is that my DD is being accused of bullying this manipulative little psycho when its actually the other way round!! I went back up on Thursday but she was &#034;too busy&#034; to see me. When i do get to speak to her she just spends her time justifying S's behaviour and telling me i need to speak to my DD about how she could be kinder! 

Now im not saying my DD is perfect, she isnt, she's loud, a bit too cheeky sometimes and can be a mouthy little thing. But she is also the kindest little girl i have ever met. She has a very strong idea of right and wrong and hates things being unfair. She is not a bully!

This is now the third school S has been in where she has been &#034;bullied&#034;. I know one of the classroom assistants from the second school she was at who has told me she wasnt bullied at all. She just wanted everyone to do everything her way and didnt like it when they kids stood up to her. She learned very young that the word bullying makes things be taken seriously and 9 times out of 10 she ends up getting exactly what she wants!


I dont know where else to turn!!

I agreed to S being dropped off a few times, but it was always hell! My DD and A play together amazingly well. They have sleepovers most weekends, but you could guarantee that within 10 minutes of S being dropped off theyre would be arguments galore or someone would be in tears so i started saying no and that we were busy when her mum textMy DDs friendship with A seemed to be a particular sticking point with S. S had befriended A and was inviting her for sleepovers and days out, then sending DD pictures with horrible messages about the fact the S and A were together without DD. My DD and A sat next to each other in class, and 1 week S got ""star of the week"" and got to pick out of the treasure chest. She picked out a seat swap pass which basically allows her to choose any seat in the class for a week. There was a whole string of messages from S to my DD saying she couldnt decide whether to swap seats with my DD or with A so that DD and A wouldnt be sat next to each other. DD had replied saying why not swap with (boy in the group) so DD, A and S could all sit together and S had replied with laughing faces and ""Why would i do that, you'll still be next to A then"" A's mum realised what was going on, as A had been sent similar messages to DD but not on the same scale. So she put a stop to the the sleepovers etc (I was still unaware of what was happening at this point) S then started messaging my DD constantly asking to come here for sleepovers and come to our house. When DD was telling her no, S was replying with very emotionally blackmailing texts including ""your mum hates me"" ""What have I done?"" ""Why dont you like me?"" ""Do you like making me sad?""  My DD was scared to speak up about it all because every time she wasnt doing exactly what S wanted, exactly when S wanted her to do it, S was accusing her of bullying her and threatening to tell the teacher that DD was a bully, that she was being nasty and making S feel sad. When I found out about all this, I asked DD if she wanted to be friends with S and she said no, that she was only being friends with her to keep her happy, but that DD wasnt happy at all. I said that was fine, that DD was allowed to have more than 1 friend and that simply not doing what someone wants is NOT bullying. I told her that if S starts trying to tell her what to do, just tell her no and go and play with someone else. Which is exactly what DD did.DD and A have been keeping to playing with each other and when S has been texting with her horrible messages DD has been either ignoring her or telling S to leave her aloneS clearly didnt like my DD sticking up for herself and has gone into full blown victim mode. She has tried (and is still trying) her best to to take A away from DD, she is constantly messaging DD saying that no one likes her, telling anyone who will listen to her that DD is a bully, and that DD doesnt like her anymore and is taking all her friends away from her.Basically everything DD does or doesnt do constitutes as her bullying SS's mother is never away from the school complaining about 1 thing and another. She has complained that S has been isolated so the seats in the class have moved so that S now sits next to A. I told DD to ignore S and just get on with it and play with other people. Few days later DD was pulled out of her class by the head teacher and asked what the problem was and why she was ignoring S. DD told the head that everytime she speaks to S or has anything to do with her she gets accused of bullying her, so she was ignoring her so she couldnt be accused of anything. Head teacher then told DD that ignoring her was also a form of bullying!!! and she had to be nice to SI was fuming and went up to the school. The class teacher said that she can see exactly whats going on, but S's mum always bypasses the class teacher and goes straight to the head. The head for some reason thinks the sun shines out of S's backside and listens to everything her mother says, then over rules the class teacher. S pushed DD out of the class line the other day, DD fell on the floor. But it was DD that got shouted at by the head for misbehaving, when it was actually S shoving her that caused her to fall I have spoken to S's mum twice now and gotten nowhere as she just denies there is a problem and says she has never been at the school about my DD (which i know for a fact is lies), but im being told from other people that she is telling other people that S is being bullied at school again by my DD!!On Thursday when the school broke up. DD was walking out of the playground with my nephew (same class), S came up behind them and butted into their conversation. They both ignored her and S grabbed DD, smirked at her and said ""youre not allowed to ignore me remember"" aaaahh!! S is still messaging my DD. Just today she has sent her a screen shot showing a 2 hour facetime call, but has cropped off who the call was too. She sent it to DD and said that the face time call had been between S and A and that A doesnt actually like my DD and that A had spent 2 hours basically sla@@ing my DD of to S. Unbeknown to S, A has been with DD all weekend, and has been at my house all day and not on facetime to S at all!! Im sick of it! DD blocked S's number, but that was another thing S and her mother used to accuse DD of bullying and isolating S. So DD panicked and unblocked her. I dont know what to do. Ive gone to the head a few times,shown her screenshots of the texts S sends but she isnt interested. She says the texts are not her concern as they are outwith school (which i do get) but the bigger picture is that my DD is being accused of bullying this manipulative little psycho when its actually the other way round!! I went back up on Thursday but she was ""too busy"" to see me. When i do get to speak to her she just spends her time justifying S's behaviour and telling me i need to speak to my DD about how she could be kinder! Now im not saying my DD is perfect, she isnt, she's loud, a bit too cheeky sometimes and can be a mouthy little thing. But she is also the kindest little girl i have ever met. She has a very strong idea of right and wrong and hates things being unfair. She is not a bully!This is now the third school S has been in where she has been ""bullied"". I know one of the classroom assistants from the second school she was at who has told me she wasnt bullied at all. She just wanted everyone to do everything her way and didnt like it when they kids stood up to her. She learned very young that the word bullying makes things be taken seriously and 9 times out of 10 she ends up getting exactly what she wants!I dont know where else to turn!!(thank you for reading if you have made it this far!)",9,"3,703", 02-04-2018 at 6.47PM

Anon (2516433),"This is such an emotional thing to write about as I never would believe I would be in the position where I am having to agree safe escape routes with my child and her school to try and keep her safe. It feels like it should be a bad dream, but it isn't. (warning long post)

My child (lets call them A) and another (lets call them B) in the same class started off as friends about 18 months ago when child B joined the school in Year 4. As my child A is SEN with vision problems and is really friendly anyway they went out of the way to make them feel welcome, but in time child B didn't want to be friends and found new ones. Child A was sad, but I explained you can't make someone your friend and they had helped child B (who has a form of autism) feel happy to join the school anyway. This made child A feel okay and they got on with school life and their own friends. 

Fast forward to September and start of year 5. Child B started to be mean to child A and spread rumours. Child A was upset so I suggested various techniques and to always report it to school. Child A had good days and bad days at school and with child B, although it now appears the good days were mainly when child B was out of class. Child B escalated to name calling and pushing around. Child A told teachers and some action was taken, but not all that would normally be (because of the autism). The form of autism affects ability to control emotion and calm down, parents have even said this bullying behaviour is CHOSEN.

Child B started to poke child A in class on a regular basis and hard. Child A at a loss as they had been told they could not say no to child B. I stomped into school to have an emergency meeting with head as this is a safeguarding issue as child A ALWAYS has a choice about their own body and to say no. That is rule 1 of avoiding abuse! School agreed that this was not appropriate actually.

Child B has now further escalated. Threatening and attacking child A with heavy ball in PE aimed at face, poking, name calling in middle of class, pushing around and making child A's life hell. School very slow to remove child B from class and to react even though in theory they have 1:1 support now due to the violence. School have said to myself and child A that child A is in no way provoking child B in any instance. Child A got in trouble for pushing child B away hard when being poked. Child B attacked child A AGAIN with heavy ball and due to teacher having difficulty restraining child B, teacher sent child A out on their own. Now child A looks like the troublemaker to the class and has said they do not feel safe at school and do not trust any of the teachers.

I have told the school they have failed child A. Their words are meaningless to child A, who is only attending school because they now have been given the right to leave if they feel unsafe (using safe escape routes and places agreed with school) and I have said I will immediately collect from school.

So question to you brave souls who have kept going to the end of this - should we keep going with the school? I know child A has friends there and loves much of the school life. Should we look to change schools to one where child A is safe, even though it feels like the bully has won? They were excluded from the last school for the same behaviour but I wonder what affect it had on the child chosen there?

Please be nice to me or don't bother to post.

Suzie B(70),"My daughter is in y6 and on friday admitted to me that she is being bullied by the 3 girls that have been her best friends for the last couple of years. This has apparently been going off for a few months. It started off by them ignoring her, telling her she couldnt be in their group anymore then they started calling her weird and strange, telling other children that she is weird and strange, encouraging other kids in her class to ignore her and exclude her from things, uninviting her from birthday parties, whispering behind her back, and she's told me theyve been coming up to our street on a night when she is playing out and shouting 'why are you so strange' my daughter has found a new group of girls to play with at school and seems happy in her new friendship group, but these 3 girls are trying to ruin her new friendship group too. My daughter was recently given the privilage of helping out in award assembleys (she gets to leave lessons 15 mins early to help the head set up and hand out certificates in assembly) on friday 2 of the girls that have been doing the bullying went to see the head, telling him that my daughter had asked if they could help her do the assemblies as she was busy doing a job for another teacher (untrue) they then went back to my daughter, told her that they would be doing the assembelies from now on, so she needed to go away because she is not wanted and that the head said if she had a problem with this then she needed yo go to his office. My daughter was devestated and came out of school crying, Has been saying all weekend she doesnt want to go to school anymore because everyone hates her, even the head! She's really down and anxious and her confidence is at an all time low, shes been like this a while but wouldnt tell me why. Ive been to see the head this morning, told him what is going on, and he seemed very concerned, said he would have a stern word with the girls involved, keep me updated, and make sure the bullying does not continue, he was very annoyed that the 2 girls had lied to him to try to take my daughters privilage away from her and he assured me that her normal assembly duties would resume and the 2 girls would receive consequences for their actions. I left happy. Then tonight my daughter has come out of school upset as the head called her out of class this morning, taken her into the office with 2 of the girls involved in the bullying and told them that they can SHARE the assembly job, and that if the other 2 girls cause anymore trouble over it, he will remove the privilage from all of them! In regards to the bullying, he has just told the other 2 girls to change their tone of voice when addressing my daughter as its upsetting her!!! To me this seems like he is rewarding the 2 girls for lying and their bad behaviour, and threatening to take away my daughters privilages if these 2 girls misbehave! Hes completely gone back on everything he said to me in our meeting. He also didnt speak to the 3rd girl involved in the bullying (i have a feeling its because her mum is a social worker and is always in school complaining) what steps do i take now?

There must have been about 20 Teenagers surrounding us at this point, pointing in my face and screaming. 
I ended up calling 999 which was useless because nobody even came!

Sara H(622),"There is no real definition of bullying. But it is usually defined as repeated behaviour intended to hurt somebody physically or emotionally.

Bullying can happen in many forms such as:

Mental
Emotional
Verbal
The more mature we get, the easier it becomes to ignore nasty words and messages that we may receive. It’s almost as though we are equipped to deal with it through experience.

Blaming and shaming are non-intentional bullying tactics that could harm a young persons self-esteem, ability to complete tasks and could in fact lead to anxiety, behavioural problems or even depression. Now these are really outdated scenarios that are still used by parents today as a condition of their upbringing.

Its like an heirloom that is passed down and accepted. These negative and intangible parenting behaviours are unknowingly engraved and unchallenged because all in all you turned out just right didn’t you?

We all know how bullying makes children feel. Yeah, it emotionally scars on some levels but a child will learn from it, wont they?

It is paramount that you communicate with your child to form a relationship with them.

Did you know that in the 1990’s, research revealed that parents spent roughly 2 and a half to 6 and a half minutes per day on average engaging with their children in meaningful communication? Do you think this is bad?

Furthermore, the “meaningful communication” isn’t what you’d expect “meaningful” to be. Conversational themes included:

“Why is your bedroom so messy? Do you like living like a pig?”
“Why don’t you have all A’s on your report card? Come on you’re smarter than that!”
“Why cant you be more like (insert name here)?”
These are known as ‘blaming’ and ‘shaming’ motivators.

Parents want the best for their children, they 99.9% of the time mean well when they speak to their children like this, but does taking this approach become the reason why your children are misbehaving? And sometimes becoming bullies themselves?

Many parents agree that when their child misbehaves, it is okay to hit them once and leave them to their own devices; but others will argue that it is child abuse.

It is also argued that the child wont do what they did wrong in the first place again because they will learn that the consequences of their actions hurt. Whereas if you are only verbally punishing your child, they are more likely to repeat their actions again and again.

So is bullying your own child into behaving a good thing to do? Or is it child abuse?There is no real definition of bullying. But it is usually defined as repeated behaviour intended to hurt somebody physically or emotionally.Bullying can happen in many forms such as:MentalEmotionalVerbalThe more mature we get, the easier it becomes to ignore nasty words and messages that we may receive. It’s almost as though we are equipped to deal with it through experience.Blaming and shaming are non-intentional bullying tactics that could harm a young persons self-esteem, ability to complete tasks and could in fact lead to anxiety, behavioural problems or even depression. Now these are really outdated scenarios that are still used by parents today as a condition of their upbringing.Its like an heirloom that is passed down and accepted. These negative and intangible parenting behaviours are unknowingly engraved and unchallenged because all in all you turned out just right didn’t you?We all know how bullying makes children feel. Yeah, it emotionally scars on some levels but a child will learn from it, wont they?It is paramount that you communicate with your child to form a relationship with them.Did you know that in the 1990’s, research revealed that parents spent roughly 2 and a half to 6 and a half minutes per day on average engaging with their children in meaningful communication? Do you think this is bad?Furthermore, the “meaningful communication” isn’t what you’d expect “meaningful” to be. Conversational themes included:“Why is your bedroom so messy? Do you like living like a pig?”“Why don’t you have all A’s on your report card?

Caitlyn F(4),"Hello,

I am a third year uni student studying a BA in Education Studies. For my dissertation research, I am really struggling to find schools who would allow me access to some of their teachers for my study. Therefore, I am now directly looking for primary school teachers to interview. However, for practicality, I have decided that we can PM for the interview.

My dissertation is on teachers' perspectives of bullying in school- their views, interventions and practices. For more information about my research, feel free to PM me.
So, if you are currently a primary school teacher (any year group, i.e. from Reception to year 6) and wouldn't mind a quick interview (on PM) of no more than 30 mins with myself, then please get in touch. It would be much appreciated.

Look forward to your responses!

Susan M(826),"Hi. I'm just looking for some advice. 

My son is in year 1. He had a best friend last year, they were so close and he was a lovely boy. Then another boy has started hanging around with them, since probably the middle of last year, and I don't think he's a very nice boy at all. I've heard one of the other parents mentioning a problem with him recently, I've also heard the way he speaks to my son, and I don't particularly like it.

Last week sometime, my son came home with a grazed nose. He told me that this other boy did it. From what my son said, it sounded like they just ran into each other, but my son said this boy did it on purpose, didn't say sorry and then that boy got told off. 

On Friday, my son came home and said that his old best friend told him that he couldn't play with them anymore. I asked my son if he'd done anything to cause this, and he said no (which I believe, he's such a sweet natured boy). So I asked him who he played with instead, and he said &#034;By myself. I liked playing on my own&#034;. This makes me feel so sad, and I'm wondering if he prefers playing by himself because that way he doesn't have any of the boys telling him what to do. We recently had an issue of these boys telling him that they were the leaders and the boss and he was a follower. I told my son that he was not a follower, that he could do whatever he wanted to do and the only people that can tell him what to do at school are his teachers. 

So I spoke to the teacher on the gate this morning, who was my son's teacher in reception. She said she'd have a word with my son's new teacher and also mention that I'd like to speak to her after school. 

The thing is, as much as it's upsetting me, my son doesn't seem to be that bothered. I was kind of hoping the issue on Friday of him not being allowed to play with them would have blown over and they'd be fine, but I watched as he went into school today. My son had obviously forgotten and ran over to play with them, and they kind of ran off, and then were sort of running in circles around him. It felt like they were tormenting him.

So I just wondered if anyone had any advice? I'll speak to his teacher tonight. Do these things usually blow over relatively quickly? I honestly thought this behaviour was what you got from girls, not boys! 

I'm also wondering if putting my son into a karate class or something like that might increase his confidence? He's not a very confident boy. He struggled so much with making friends in nursery and I was so glad he had a nice group of friends, but now he's apparently not allowed to play with them anymore! And there aren't a huge amount of boys in his class to play with. I just feel so sad at the thought of him on his own.Hi.  I'm just looking for some advice.  My son is in year 1.  He had a best friend last year, they were so close and he was a lovely boy.  Then another boy has started hanging around with them, since probably the middle of last year, and I don't think he's a very nice boy at all.  I've heard one of the other parents mentioning a problem with him recently, I've also heard the way he speaks to my son, and I don't particularly like it.Last week sometime, my son came home with a grazed nose.  He told me that this other boy did it.  From what my son said, it sounded like they just ran into each other, but my son said this boy did it on purpose, didn't say sorry and then that boy got told off.  On Friday, my son came home and said that his old best friend told him that he couldn't play with them anymore.  I asked my son if he'd done anything to cause this, and he said no (which I believe, he's such a sweet natured boy).  So I asked him who he played with instead, and he said ""By myself.  I liked playing on my own"".  This makes me feel so sad, and I'm wondering if he prefers playing by himself because that way he doesn't have any of the boys telling him what to do.  We recently had an issue of these boys telling him that they were the leaders and the boss and he was a follower.  I told my son that he was not a follower, that he could do whatever he wanted to do and the only people that can tell him what to do at school are his teachers.  So I spoke to the teacher on the gate this morning, who was my son's teacher in reception.  She said she'd have a word with my son's new teacher and also mention that I'd like to speak to her after school.  The thing is, as much as it's upsetting me, my son doesn't seem to be that bothered.  I was kind of hoping the issue on Friday of him not being allowed to play with them would have blown over and they'd be fine, but I watched as he went into school today.  My son had obviously forgotten and ran over to  play with them, and they kind of ran off, and then were sort of running in circles around him.  It felt like they were tormenting him.So I just wondered if anyone had any advice?  I'll speak to his teacher tonight.  Do these things usually blow over relatively quickly?  I honestly thought this behaviour was what you got from girls, not boys!  I'm also wondering if putting my son into a karate class or something like that might increase his confidence?  He's not a very confident boy.  He struggled so much with making friends in nursery and I was so glad he had a nice group of friends, but now he's apparently not allowed to play with them anymore!  And there aren't a huge amount of boys in his class to play with.  I just feel so sad at the thought of him on his own.",0,"2,127", 20-11-2017 at 10.23AM  
Bibi C,"Is there such a thing as bullying from teachers? My kid is inyear 6 in independent school. I am scared of asking him about his day, he is often sullen with us when he comes home, and I have spoken at length about this with the head teacher. She investigates and says one event can be reported differently.

My son Said he felt humiliated in front of whole class as he'd got 0% in mathletics. It was the way it was told, as he said others who had not done their mathletics challenges were told in a more light hearted tone, to get on and do them. The teacher also said, your parents are coming in, and This doesn't help. 

We are rather taken aback. They're doing entrance test practice and he is struggling. His scores are less than 30% on maths, and they say his English needs to have more complex sentences, subordinates, etc. He lacks concentration. I've asked several people including the head and the GP how to help him, and they say it's normal, can be much worse in other boys. His reports endofyeat, start of year are above average/significantly above average. He's in a class of thirteen. Two classes in his year. 
I wake up panicking as I've had the negative reports about his experience at school since reception class, so am possibly now hyper anxious. Particularly about his well-being. He pushes boundaries at home, despite me telling him the consequences each time. He's feeling so low. 
I've been following positive parenting to build up his internal strengths, and focus on the things going right.That's when we we at our best. Though I can't ever get the school to work in the positives. That's when my faith in it dissipates. 
If you complain at school, things get worse for him. It's been every year, generally autumn term, sometimes spring term. How do you help your child? Other mums say it gets worse in teen years. Really need some advice. Just to get through one day of difficulty at school.Is there such a thing as bullying from teachers? My kid is inyear 6 in independent school.

Summer B(21),"So this is a subject which is risky to post as people love to take offence to everything these days lol. Before I start, I am not racist, prejudice or discriminatory before people get the wrong end of the stick..I do NOT mean to insult or upset anybody but I really do want to get something off my chest as it is bothering my child.

So I am a white female. 
My boy, was happy,intelligent bubbly and outgoing, became very withdrawn at school
The teacher said he had started to sit alone at lunch and sit by himself in the playground.
I asked my boy what was going on. He said Im the only white boy in my class and the othes make fun of me and hit me.
He said they call him racist names which I cant say on this. They make fun of him for being white.
In this Catholic school, there are also children of other religions, who are making fun of his religion and colour.
I cant understand this at all. I am against racism and discriminating and bullying. I hate it because I teach my kid to accept everybodys differences. My kid doesnt want to go to school now. On my street theres 2 other white kids, they are the minority, the rest are black and asian and they all play happily together. I wont sugar coat it though, he has experienced racism from some black and asian kids before on the street. But in general its ok. And Im not saying black or asian kids dont experience racism, but my point is, my child is experience racial bullying for being white. 

When I met with the principal, I said he feels singled out being the only white child in the class.
He said he would deal with the whole situation. My boy came home from school in tears. At break time, they made him sit with 2 white Polish children from the year below him, who didnt speak English.

Im confused and angry about the whole situation. Did he sit them with the polish kids because they were white? That wasnt what I wanted him to do, matching people up based on colour!!!! I feel like the bullying should have been dealt with first and foremost, the bullies should be punished... but nothing was done about that. and I also feel like my child shouldnt have to feel strange or weird for being the only white child in the class.

What should I do? I dont want to move my child from school based on race. That is morally wrong and im not a racist person. But my child is being singled out by other children for being white and being the minority in his school.
I have mixed race cousins who i love dearly. and I have indian, black &amp; white best friends too. I would be just as angry if my child was the only black kid in the class getting bullied. Its awful. But now my kid doesnt want to go school or his after school activities because hes paranoid and embarrassed to be the only white kids. My heart hurts for the boy. I dont want him to end up feeling resentment to other races and growing up with a chip on his shoulder due to his treatment from a lot of them. I try my best to teach him were all the same.

Also the situation is getting worse because now My kids dad who i am not with, is telling my boy to call names back and fight back.I dont want my kid saying racist stuff to get his own back on them. So i feel like his dad is telling him to fight racism with racism. Which is not going down in my house.

I understand where my ex is coming from as he is hurt what our boy is going throug and hes lashing out. He wants me to move area and change schools. To a more diverse area with more white people so my kid isnt singled out and hes even said move to an area with more white and black so its more equal.
I just think thats extreme but I get what hes saying. But thats giving into the racist bullies and I refuse to be driven out of my area. This might sound awful but isnt that just handing my hometown to another race. If that makes sense.

Im lost on this topic. HELP!!

the last week has been horrendous he has been called names due to his learning difficulties and health issues he has glue ear and has not much hearing in his one ear this caused speech delay
the abuse this week was at first verbal but today has come to a head when he was shoved down the stairs and whilst he was on the floor they pushed him up against a radiator bruising his face 
my son is very sensitive and came to me about it i phoned the school immediately who advised that my son needs to go to his tutor with any issues and not me they feel he is too reliant on me and they like things dealt with in school as parents getting to involved in these situations complicates matters and takes things longer to get dealt with
so my child gets physically hurt they dont notify by phone and i am supposed to not get involved am fuming 
my son has been advised he needed to write a statement of what happened which we have done 
if they dont wont parents getting involved how am i supposed to know if its dealt with the school say i have to follow there policy my dad has cancer and my son is struggling am dreading tomorrow just wish i could make it all stop

Deleted profile,"My 6 year old daughter is being bullied at her school. I went into the school on numerous occasions last term as a result of this. Initially the headmistress told me that there was no problem at school and that she must be unhappy at home and was blaming the school. I was then informed by the class teacher that she was being bullied at school by one girl in particular and that they would deal with it. She also told me that the headmistress was aware of the situation.

We have had a lovely holiday and she returned to school last Thursday. She seemed fine in the evening but then woke up screaming 5 times in the night, she told me that this girl had been picking on her againat school. I again went into the school to be told that they thought that Madeleine was over reacting and that the child involved was leaving in July so she only had two terms to put up with it. After school on the Friday she told me that she had been grabbed and yelled at by another child ( thye best friend of the main one). I think that if the other children see the main instigator getting away with it they will copy her. 

The teachers also say that Madeleine should realise thay only pick on her as they are jealous of her, we have just got back to this country from living abroad and so she speaks spanish and has had a lot of different experiences. I don't think this helps. What do I do now I feel as if the teachers are closing ranks against me.My 6 year old daughter is being bullied at her school. I went into the school on numerous occasions last term as a result of this. Initially the headmistress told me that there was no problem at school and that she must be unhappy at home and was blaming the school. I was then informed by the class teacher that she was being bullied at school by one girl in particular and that they would deal with it. She also told me that the headmistress was aware of the situation.We have had a lovely holiday and she returned to school last Thursday.

louise s(699),"My 7 year olds best friend has come round for a play after school... 

She said that everyone bullies my dd.. two boys punched and hit her in the arm today... Everyone says she smells and laughs at her..

My dd is so quite and has never told me any of this... I asked her why and she said she forgets.. 

Dd is in the process of getting assessed with camhs as she has a few difficulties in school.. But she's a really quite shy girl.. She only has one friend in her class the girl round today) and if she's off which seems to be a lot then she has no one to play with...
 
Apparently she was told off today and sent into the corridor because a boy next to her was talking when he shouldn't have been so she put here finger on his lips... Which obviously isn't best and needs a word. But she was told off in front of everyone and was crying hysterically. But she's been kicked, slapped had things taken off her names called at her... and what happened... 

I wondered if she's not remembered to tell me then maybe she's not that bothered... But then I think she should be, I need to teach her not to accept it... And she never tells me anything about school good or bad anyway.. 

I had a meeting last week with her new teacher and the schools support assistant about a recently made child plan stating some of the things that she struggles with... communication low confidence ad self esteem being some of them.

I think I'm going to try grab the teacher tomorrow at pick up... but it feels a little weak saying her friend has told me all these things but my DD won't tell me anything at all.... 

My mental health is really bad at the moment and tbh some days I'm just managing to get out to take her to school and pick her up.. I'm really not up for a big fight with the school I'm really really struggling....

Gem06nvj,"I have a 4yo boy, who is now in full time school. He's always been quite &#034;difficult&#034; and to me, stands out so much compared to other children the same age simply because of his attitude.
I am a single parent, and there is just myself and his little sister at home. He was in contact with his dad up until about 7 months ago when he decided to abandon him, because of his behaviour. 
He has never really seen any form of agression from anywhere yet he is so aggressive. He answers back constantly. Naughty step etc has never really worked, taking things off him doesn't really work. Its quite scary how un-bothered he is about not only his actions but also the punishments. I feel like a total failure if I'm honest. And it upsets me massively. I come from a very respectable family, and I was brought up very well myself, and no matter how much I try with him he constantly goes against everything I ever brought him up to be. He's fully aware of the difference between right/wrong. Yet chooses wrongly everytime. 
The reason for my post is, today after school his teacher pulled me aside and said he had been alongside another boy, kicking a nursery child repeatedly in the head. Naturally my heart sank. I didn't raise a bully. There has been another incident many years ago when he was at nursery himself and I went to collect him and with my own eyes saw 4boys, hitting another boy one after the other and the 5th boy about to do the hitting was my son. This was also another heart sinking moment. 
He doesn't listen. At all. He shouts. He can often be physically aggressive as well as verbally. I literally do not know what to do. I spoke to a health visitor about his behaviour around a year ago and she then started suggesting I aim for a diagnosis of a behavioural issue. I don't think he has anything to be diagnosed. I just generally feel that he is simply, a bad kid. And it really does break my heart. I don't want to be the one with the nightmare child that everybody hates. I wouldn't wish it on any one else either but I don't want it. I don't know how I can &#034;fix him&#034; I have tried every piece of advice general internet searches have to offer - i am scared about his future - there are a lot of teenagers around here who are &#034;nightmares&#034; and I don't want my baby to be one of those :(
How can I nip this behaviour in the bud? 
How can I end this and make him realise the seriousness of his actions? As well as making him understand and actually care about the consequences ?I have a 4yo boy, who is now in full time school.

Carried on. So I wrote to OFSTED who told me they don't deal with bullying and go to LA. When I phoned LA I am not allowed to speak to them, however in 15 days if I don't receive a response she doesn't meet the criteria!!!!

Friday I received a call telling me she had punched someone (my daughter has never been violent). So I talk to her and she said she would never do this and what actually happened was they were doing a dance on stage, when she did a spin she hit the girl accidentally.

I don't know what to do or where to go. She only has four weeks left, but the boys and now this is making her life a misery.

Miranda H(50),"I have posted a lot about my children being bullied. My eldest was bullied at the start of the school year verbally and physically by a child with SEN. After endless conversations with her teacher and deputy head the issue was finally sorted. Excellent I thought. 
From January until 3 weeks ago my youngest was also physically and verbally attacked. She got it far worse than her sister, even being filmed by this child with threats of it being put on the Internet. She had bruises, and bit marks, black eyes and still has a sore back from an incident a month ago. 
I had been to see the teacher and deputy but nothing got done. The only incident they ever dealt with was the filming of her. In the end I removed her from school and said she would be back when they could keep her safe 
As soon as I did this the head agreed to see me. They said this boy was now going to arrive for school and 5 minutes late and leave 5 minutes after the other children. He would spend lunch with a member of staff and my daughter was given a book with happy and sad faces. If he had bullied her she would colour in a sad face and she could choose someone to share it with. When I kept her off school her whole class (except the boy who'd bullied her) made her a lovely book filled with pictures and messages saying how much they liked her and were all on her side (I nearly burst into tears when I read it). 
Since she returned to school there has not been one issue. I wish I had done this earlier but am glad I did it in the end. For the last 3 weeks there have been no tears in the morning or stomach aches Sunday night. My children are actually smiling as they go to school. 
So to all parents out there sometimes being a bit more dramatic gets you what you need. Don't stop going in to school. If they fob you off escalate it or remove them. It worked for us. Thinking of you all and remember it's nearly the summer holidays.I have posted a lot about my children being bullied.

Anon (2425222),"Hi 

My daughter is in year 1 and she is having some issues at school with her &#034;friend&#034; at school.

For the past 2 months or so, she is saying she either doesn't want to go to school or she doesn't like school, because a certain girl is her class is &#034;bossy&#034;.

Basically, to start i should say my daughter is quite sensitive. She is mature for her age, and wears her heart on her sleeve. She is very empathetic.

The girl causing the issues is actually her &#034;friend&#034; that she has been friends with since reception. Recently, this girl has been saying to my daughter that you have to do x, y or z or i am going to tell the teacher. My daughter, being quite sensitive, knowing the teacher won't do anything because someone is telling tales, still gets quite upset about it.
This girl, demands things like save me a space at the dinner table, or dont play with such n such, tells her to do stupid stuff like act like a clown or pull funny faces and then proceeds to threaten my daughter with getting into trouble with the teachers. I should mention my child have never been at trouble at school, bar one time she went to the loo without informing the teacher.

I have spoken to the girls mum, she has had a word with her daughter but its still happening and its quite upsetting for my daughter, even more so because all her group of friends play with this girl, so if she leaves them to it, shes basically left wandering the playground on her own, crying.

How would you approach this? Is my child jus extra sensitive to normal child behaviour or is this child being a bully? The girl is persistent in her behaviour until my dd starts crying. I personally find this behaviour unacceptable, if she was an adult she would be classed as be a controlling narcissist imo, she is basically not happy until my dd is following her every word even then she will still threaten her with getting into trouble. I have spoken to her mum, its not worked, so what now???Hi My daughter is in year 1 and she is having some issues at school with her ""friend"" at school.For the past 2 months or so, she is saying she either doesn't want to go to school or she doesn't like school, because a certain girl is her class is ""bossy"".Basically, to start i should say my daughter is quite sensitive.

Azra.T,"Hi, I was wondering if anyone had any tips on how to stop my 9 year old from sucking her thumb? She's currently going into her fifth year at primary school and her thumb is constantly in her mouth. We've tried putting the nail polish thing but she still puts her thumb in without touching the polish. I'm worried she's going to start getting bullied if it carries on, I think she's had comments already from other kids. What can I do?

Tra34igg,"hi mums,
I'm looking for a bit of advice. My son is 11 and is very sensitive. He's always been like this and I thought he would grow out if it. He gets really upset with any name calling and doesn't make friends easily. The perception is that he can't take a joke. He is quick to say kids are picking on him and play the victim.

Kamilla J,"Hi,
I need some advice, please.

So for the past 1 month my son has been saying, he doesn't wan't to go to school every morning. I spoke to his teacher about it and she assured me she will try to find out what's going on.

Anyway fast forward today when I went to pick him up, his teacher asked to speak to me about an incident. She told me that at lunchtime today my son hit a girl, quite bad that he bruised her hand, and yesterday with a different kid he throw a pencil at him. I asked if they were any provoke or anything? She said no they were non. 

At this point, my son was visibly very upset. When we got home I sat him down to talk to him. He was crying saying he didn't do anything wrong and that a girl hit him &#034;in my head&#034;

Now I should mention, my son has a speech impairment, and so he is not able to explain things well as other kids.
As a mom I am extremely concerned and the fact that his teacher has concluded it was my son's fault completely. 
I am not trying to be biased but I believe there is more to the story, that either his teacher is not aware of or just choose to ignore it.

My son is in year 2.

Any advise will be highly appreciated and thank you in advance for replying.Hi,I need some advice, please.So for the past 1 month my son has been saying, he doesn't wan't to go to school every morning.

Kir21vxt,"A little background to my situation.....back in Oct/Nov 2016 my daughter who's in Yr 1 told me a girl in her class had hit her and called her 'mean and nasty'. I spoke to the class teacher at the time and no further things happened until March this year. Around mid March my Dd told me that this same girl was calling her mean and nasty again, threatening physical violence (not carried out) and following her when my dd tried to ignore and walk away. She told me this was happening daily. I spoke to the other girls mum and the girl admitted she'd been unkind and apologised. I also informed the teacher. The following week my dd started not wanting to go to school as she worried about being picked on again. 

Following this I had a long chat with the teacher, expressing my concern that this current behaviour was unlike my dd. The teacher assured me that she'd notify the other teachers to monitor the situation and would start a log about any further incidents. When I got home from this chat my dd said 'I'm not going to cry to anyone,...***** said if I do she won't be my friend anymore'. Since that comment and until the Easter holidays my dd would only say the odd thing like this girl wouldn't let her play.

We had two blissful weeks without any mention of this girl over Easter. We booked our dd's birthday party for June and she told me who she'd like to invite....this girl was not on the list.
Within two days of starting back at school my dd starting telling us this girl was making mean faces at her. It seems an almost daily occurrence and other incidents are closing a door in her face, telling her she's the only person who she doesn't like.

This last weekend my dd has been crying Friday evening (doesn't understand why this girl says she's mean and why she's not her friend); grumpy and moody Sunday (says she's worried about this girl being mean) and on Monday she described her brain as 'twisted' (think she means confused) she says she can't stop thinking about this girl.

Since seeing the teacher back in March I've had no feedback regarding the 'log' and in her latest homework my dd wrote '***** is being unkind to me. It makes me sad'. The teacher has discussed this with her today but not me.

I'm planning on going to speak to the teacher tomorrow after school again. Just not sure whether I should arrange a more formal meeting? Is there anything else anyone would suggest we do?

We've continued to positively praise our dd and tried to discuss coping mechanisms such as walking away, telling the teacher and responses such as 'yeah whatever'. We've also reinforced what a star she is and how she has lots of lovely friends at school.A little background to my situation.....back in Oct/Nov 2016 my daughter who's in Yr 1 told me a girl in her class had hit her and called her 'mean and nasty'.

Tra23zhj,"My 12 yr old is being bullied! He seems to be a target (he's well mannered and polite so gets punched and kicked by boys walking past him for being &#034;gay or a puff&#034;) He's tall and handsome ( name calling because of his hair and dark eyes; must be wearing eyeliner!) He's loyal and sticks up for people if they're being treat wrong ( &#034;freak&#034;). He has experienced rascism ( he is caucasian) and personal aspects have been used to upset him. 

He was recently assaulted in class which resulted in a black eye! the boy was suspended for 3 days and another boy given detention. We decided to allow the school to deal with this and not involve the police. The boys involved have now left him alone.

However other boys now see him as a target because quite simply he is a gentle soul and won't fight back......

I am considering changing schools as after a discussion with school I have been informed he is not settling and is always alone! He has no friends but outside of school he has. I really don't want to change schools, it is the best school in our area BUT a handful of kids are basically, awful! Do I wait and see if school can sort it or get him out?

Im practically raising my son on my own and thank God Im doing not sooo great but Im coping well so far for over 7years til now. My 8 year old son soon to be 9 this july asked me a month before school ends if he could transfer to a different school. I was caught off guard coz I was not expecting him wanting to transfer and I thought all was well with him at school not until he asked me again the second and third time. So, I asked him why? It took me 2months or so to make him tell me. He was scared to talk at first, then he cried and started telling me why. He was vebally abused by his bully, not just 1kid but 3. Should I give my son what he asks? Please help, thanks

Anon (2383567),"Hi, I hope to get some advice here as I really don't know where to go.
 
My son is 6yrs and he is very sociable, clever and very kind. He used to enjoy going to school, didn't have any major problems. Until this year's teacher came and it all changed. My son got very quite, he's become really anxious and started saying he didn't want to go to school. He has wet his pants a few times because he was too scared to ask teacher if he could go to the loo. This has also happened to at least one other child in his class but the parents didn't want to raise the issue with the teacher. When I finally had a chance to speak to teacher, she said she didn't see any problems. 

It's hard to get anything out of my son about school, he doesn't like talking about school. He always gets good marks on his tests and homework but never gets a &#034;well done&#034; from the teacher. He is put in punishment a lot (his name is on the thundercloud) for trivial things or reasons that are not his fault. He has never had a reward or anything, although he was told he would as he was behaving so well. But apparently there was no time. One time he was punished because a special needs child in the class kicked off and both adults left the room, the children were left unattended. My son was scared and got up from his place, when the teacher came back she punished him. I feel he is being treated unfairly, I think the teacher is a bully for making children scared of her. But I have no idea how to handle this.Hi, I hope to get some advice here as I really don't know where to go. My son is 6yrs and he is very sociable, clever and very kind.

Karla D(319),"Hi, I've been reading posts on this &amp; tried to find some answers as I'm not really getting anywhere with the school etc. My son is 14, he attends an LCR within a mainstream school, he took so long to settle in &amp; make friends coming from his last school &amp; I worried constantly about this, but he is settled &amp; lives it, his work is fantastic &amp; I'm so happy with the progress he has made until recently. A girl told him she liked him in the LCR which I thought nothing of &amp; he ignored it, but another boy wasn't happy at this and took an immediate disliking to him because of this. This has since resulted in online threats, verbal threats in school &amp; recently he was almost attacked which the headteacher witnessed and intervened build he had not been there God knows what would have happened, I was told the boy was suspended &amp; then I found out that this wasn't the case he was moved to a different part of the school &amp; has now been allowed to reattend the unit. My son isn't violent or confrontational in the slightest &amp; he doesn't cause trouble which the teachers have all said themselves, the school said they logged everything that had happened and last week my son broke down in what looked like an anxiety attack saying he cannot go back he would rather be dead than go back while he is there!! This is affecting his work &amp; he has recently came out in psoaris &amp; his consultant said whilst he would have gotten it anyway she definitely thinks it is stress related. I haven't sent him now for a week. I contacted the council &amp; they said I had to send in a formal complaint &amp; then take if further if I didn't get the outcome expected. The boy has targeted other people also &amp; has attacked others, but the school seems to not want to kick him out regardless of what he does, he is violent &amp; disruptive &amp; seems to think swearing &amp; speaking to teachers whatever way he pleases is acceptable &amp; his parents who I had a meeting with also seem to think that he isn't that bad!! They weren't decent people in my opinion, they looked like they had rolled out of bed &amp; couldn't be bothered to be there!! The school even said them selves they didn't think the parents were able to control him so he does as he wants. I'm ranting &amp; I apologise but the point is now that I have had an email telling me a meeting is arranged for next Tuesday to resolve the situation but I won't be happy until the bully is out of school, I think this is a reasonable request given the amount of trouble he has caused with this &amp; previously. I just want to know if anyone has been in a similar situation &amp; what they did, also should I take anyone with me? Or contact a lawyer? Moving my son isn't ideal I think it would cause him more harm than good &amp; I don't think he should be the one to uproot his life due to this due to a bully after taking so long to settle there.

The first time we reported it, it was a few girls with one ring leader, we told the school, had meetings, they took statements from all students involved.

My daughter I think keep quiet about it for a while until it was more than she thought she could handle or take anymore before she told me and it resorted in self harm which we have since seen someone about and she has stopped at the moment.

I kept my daughter out of school until the contract was drawn up and everyone signed itI asked what consequence would the bullies get as they have all broken the contract. All they said was that they cannot discuss the girls sanctions and with this new contract its more formal and would be taken more seriously.sophies attendance, work at school efforts etc all dip when the bullying comes back and then she gets a detention for too many behavior points.she is back at school today after being off because bullying for the past few days. My daughter never misses a day unless she's really I'll or bullying and her grades and efforts dip too but the school refuse to see this as the bullying it at fault so she has detention a day after she's goes back and she feels she's being punished.she has been made to feel its her fault and the school are carrying out their polices on how they handle it.

If and when it carries on I predict more excuses and brushing things under the carpet,in the meantime my daughter well-being suffers and I do not want her to start self harming again. please help and sorry for the essay.",5,"2,956", 22-03-2017 at 2.07PM  
Kirsty D(391),"My son has been enjoying joining in football lately at school but sounds like the other boys don't want him to play.
He told me one boy grabbed him by the face shouting &#034;who said you can play&#034; and thrown him to the ground. 
And this one in particular kept saying things during the game like you are not a proper footballer. My son said this hurt his feelings and he said the boy keeps trying to get him sent off,grabbing his coat etc. From what my son has told me it sounds like the boys have only been letting him play if he is the goal keeper because he is &#034;useful&#034; and now not liking it because he is trying to get involved with kicking the ball about. He said a few people where on his team then everyone went on the other boys team.

Basically keeps trying to kiss her and stroking her face trying to hold her hand. running around yard saying that they are lesbian together. They went away last week with school ended up on same room and same thing happened. If my dd tells teacher the girl goes around telling school not to play with her.

Ami F(6),"This is a LONG one sorry!! 
Our son started Upper School as a year 7 student this September.
He was an innocent and confident young man, excited for the adventures secondary school held before him. 
In the last few months much has changed. He has been through trials and tribulations aplenty. 
On the 27th of October he was brutally attacked by two older children from The school
This attack began with our young son being shunted off his bike by another boy who was on his bike; My lovely son subsequently fell to the ground with the bike brake then being impaled in to his upper thigh. The perpetrator and his accomplice then continued to physically assault Our whilst he lay on the floor in agony.

Once this dramatic and traumatic attack had come to an end it took the two ambulance crews and the fire brigade approximately two hours to release him from his bike and get him in to an ambulance to gain medical attention at the hospital, culminating in two operations followed by rehabilitation for muscle damage. It's fair to say that some support was offered from the school with regards to his mobility during recovery. 

Since this initial incident, Our baby has been subject to several other instances of assault/intimidation bullying and threatening behaviour within the school grounds, where he is supposed to be under the care of the school.

He has been subject to bullying comments, stalked and intimidated on the way home from school by two brothers which also involved a threat to his life by way of being &#034;stabbed with a compass” - these incidents were reported to the school and as far as I am aware no action has been taken. It's noteworthy that Our son even goes as far to say that his story was not believed by the staff he alerted to these particular threats and intimidation. 

Our son was again attacked on the 07/12/2016 - where he was attacked in the canteen, playground and toilet on three separate occasions by the same child during a thirty minute lunch break. I find it hard to believe that no staff were around to witness any of these assaults?

These attacks resulted in My baby attending the first aid room where he was checked over by staff for injuries. During this visit to first aid due to no fault of his own, has ended up sitting on and standing on two separate contaminated discarded needles, which I have been advised are for diabetic children on the premises

This situation can only be described as Gross Negligence on behalf of the staff responsible, it begs the question if they are adequately trained to be doing such a role. 

I might also add that the staff waited for almost two hours before contacting us which is dumbfounding.

Due to the inadequate response received from the member of staff who contacted us, we have then had to take Our son to accident and emergency to test his blood sugar levels and also to undergo blood tests to establish if he is now infected with a disease as a result of this gross negligence. 

Having briefly read through the school policies I can quickly identify at least three which have not been upheld: 

- Safeguarding and Child Protection Policy 
- Anti-Bullying Policy
- Health &amp; Safety Policy 

Not to mention the various Health &amp; Safety/ Department of Education regulations which have been broken in the first aid room alone. 


TODAY our little boy was once again been attacked, He has been subjected to being hit, verbal abuse and food being thrown at him, then walking home from school he was punched in the face !!!! 
Our son is now scared to return to school and says he is going to kill himself, I am beside myself and keep re assuring him, I have yet another meeting with the school but I am so scared and worried for my lovely son....This is a LONG one sorry!!  Our son started Upper School as a year 7 student this September.He was an innocent and confident young man, excited for the adventures secondary school held before him.

Sta74tax,"Hi all,

Recently, my 11 year old daughter was targeted online by a group of boys at her school. One particular message threatened her with an assault of a sexual nature. My daughter is autistic and has been targeted on several occasions in her years at school. Having liaised (admittedly quite aggressively) with her school, I was assured the consequences would be severe. These boys got a single day in isolation. Am I the only person who finds that ridiculous? When the assistant Head told me it was a &#034;serious consequence&#034; I didn't know whether to laugh or cry. 
Having done some research, I discovered the school has no dedicated anti-bullying policy and several children locally have already been removed. 
What I am wondering is exactly how prevalent this seemingly turning a blind eye to bullying is? Opinions would be greatly appreciated. The anger and frustration is driving me mad.

Hel89iir,"Hi 

Not sure if I should take this further or put is down to a learning lesson for my son. Any advice would be greatly received. 

My son who is 9 was recently teased in class by the school teacher (he was only covering for that afternoon). He made fun of the way my son laughed which in turn made the whole class laugh at him. Then for the rest of the afternoon he could not laugh as he was teased by his classmates and every time he did something in class he felt like he was being laughed at. 

He is very sensitive and do know he needs to become a little tougher for high school. However when I called the school to advise how upset he was and how I felt the teacher should be not be basically giving permission for the rest of the class to laugh at and tease my son, I was told the Teacher is wonderful every one loves him he is so funny but obviously the emotional immature child don't always get him?!

Apparently he is a very sarcastic teacher which is fine - sarcasm my son has dealt with but this was making fun of a child not sarcasm. I do see this as bullying, the Headteacher has said she will discuss the incident with my son. I am going to wait to see how he feels about it afterwards if he is ok with what was said then I will probably let it lie. 

What are other peoples views on this - is it something which should be laughed off by the head and seen as the child's problem for not understanding sarcasm or should it be dealt with in a more sensitive manor?

My daughter has become friends with a new girl at secondary school, they are both in year 8 and since this girl started it's become apparent that she has serious mental problems, she threatens to commit suicide and self harms.

She watches a lot of horror movies and then tells my daughter all about them giving her subsequent nightmares. She tells my daughter she wants to die as no one cares about her. I believe she is having counselling but clearly it's not doing any good. This girls mum then invited my daughter on a shopping trip with them but we were busy so I invited this girl round for tea to make up for my daughter not going and since then this girl had taken to asking if when she comes round she can 'have things' like my daughters phone etc
Now my daughter is so fretful about this Friday and she was in tears last night. 
Do I speak to the parents about all this, I reckon they don't know the half of it or speak to the school ? What would others do in the same situation ?

Kel60nvl,"Hi, this is my first time using Net Mums and I guess I desperately need advice. My sons school called me the other day to come in for a meeting. It turns out my 9 year old son has been bullying two 7 year old boys. I am totally devastated to think my son could do such a cruel horrible inexcusable thing. He is their dinner server at lunch time and, for several weeks now, has been hitting them under the table and pushing their legs against the table leg (one poor boy ended up with a bruise). My husband and I have spoken, screamed and cried at my son to explain why he has done this. He just keeps saying he doesn't know. As punishment he has to go to his room as soon as schools over and we have taken all his computer games etc off him for the foreseeable future but I just don't feel it's enough. Previous to this my son has been a kind gentle boy. His school report in July me said he was quiet, well mannered, honest, and a very respectful boy. This has taken ourselves and the school totally hy surprise. My son claims he never wanted to hurt them, when I point out that he knew by hitting them it would hurt (which he agrees with), then I say again so you did want to hurt them, he cries and says no?!?! I am totally devastated and I know the parents of the two small boys must be frantic and frightened, and to think my son has done this is unbelievable. I have googled how to handle this situation and there is not a lot of advise out there. So I guess I'm wondering has anyone else been through this? If so what advise would you give?? I know people will not understand this, but as angry as I am with my son, and a please believe me I am furious, I am also worried about how he could have changed so much since his school report 4 months ago?!?!Hi, this is my first time using Net Mums and I guess I desperately need advice. My sons school called me the other day to come in for a meeting. It turns out my 9 year old son has been bullying two 7 year old boys. I am totally devastated to think my son could do such a cruel horrible inexcusable thing. He is their dinner server at lunch time and, for several weeks now, has been hitting them under the table and pushing their legs against the table leg (one poor boy ended up with a bruise). My husband and I have spoken, screamed and cried at my son to explain why he has done this. He just keeps saying he doesn't know. As punishment he has to go to his room as soon as schools over and we have taken all his computer games etc off him for the foreseeable future but I just don't feel it's enough. Previous to this my son has been a kind gentle boy. His school report in July me said he was quiet, well mannered, honest, and a very respectful boy. This has taken ourselves and the school totally hy surprise. My son claims he never wanted to hurt them, when I point out that he knew by hitting them it would hurt (which he agrees with), then I say again so you did want to hurt them, he cries and says no?!?!

Dee74ldi,"My 12 year old slight build Aspergers boy had his leg badly broken 2 days ago at his first day of after school Rugby Training. This was a non contact training session where the boys were supposed to be carrying out a passing the ball exercise to each other . A larger boy came over and rugby tackled my boy. My son says doesn't remember what actually happened as he was concussed and in shock. The 2 coaches phoned me to say my boy had been injured and to collect him. They said they didn't see the incident but would investigate and said they we almost sure there was nothing broken as they had flexed his leg etc , but I might like to get it checked out.
My son was in unbelievable pain, &amp; shivering . After several hours in A&amp;E I had to go to a private hospital costing £450, where they confirmed he had 2 really bad brakes and a fracture in his big lower leg bone, &amp; that he would be in full leg plaster for 12 weeks and would miss minimum of 2 week of school. He has been in excruciating pain , sick and can't even go to the toilet ..it's heartbreaking. 
My question is can I sue the boys parents, or the school for coaches not being vigilant enough. The boy has admitted tackling my boy and 2 witnesses has confirmed this. The school VP called today to say they were contacting the boys parents for interview
My boy loves his school and is really upset that he can't return until after xmas. he is missing out on so much , in pain. Im having to take 3 weeks off and cancel holidays to look after him.I feel the boy should be expelled to demonstrate that this behaviour will not be tolerated but wonder if it's worth perusing . Some advise would be greatly appreciated as Im not an ambulance chaser but want some form of recompense and apology from the boy &amp; his parents .My 12 year old slight build Aspergers boy had his leg badly broken 2 days ago at his first day of after school Rugby Training.

Sop46agp,"Hi, 

My son is in reception and has been put in a class with the his nemesis from nursery (the nursery attached to the school) its a whole year he has been getting bullied now.

The teacher says she cant do anything about it because my son never tells her its happening. How can I get him to tell her? I tell him, she tells him. Still he won't tell and so she cant act on it except by keeping th separate in class. Yesterday my son made 2 walkie talkies one for him one for his best mate. The nemesis came up and snatched my kids walkie talkie then the teacher saw my son was near the bully and sent my kid to the home corner. He never got his walkie talkie back. I feel like the teacher is bullying my kid now. She is so bored of me banging on about this problem. Pretty bored of it myself. Also bored of the bed wetting night mares night terrors and his constant whinging about this kid.

Ive bought some books, the huge bag of worries and how to stop bullying Ive cut his hair shorter and sent him to martial arts. In this book it says they need play dates to help build self esteem, but I dont know what age it means. He has playdates with my friend kids...but do 5 year olds have play dates with kids of their choosing? Where, at the park etc? How do you go about organising these things?Hi, My son is in reception and has been put in a class with the his nemesis from nursery (the nursery attached to the school) its a whole year he has been getting bullied now.The teacher says she cant do anything about it because my son never tells her its happening.

jes22kvh,"So at first I thought I was being petty as most children argue with their friends but lately my friends son who is 5 has started punching my son 5 when he doesn't do what he wants him to do.

My friend has the moto and has drilled into her son if &#034;if someone hits you, hit them harder and don't cry to me&#034; 

I've warned her many times that it could go to the extreme where he turns into a bully, me and her have such different parenting, she smacks her son hard and if he cries and screams she will smack him again. I have a marble jar which usually works if not then he will be grounded (no I pad, or tv) ... there's flaws in each. 

My question is how the hell do I stop the hitting I've tried to approach her about it and give some advice about it but she just gets very defensive. E.g 

My son was playing at her house with her son and another friend from school, my son come to my friend and said &#034; he just punched me in the face&#034; we got to the bottom of why it happened and it turns out the 2 other boys where building blocks and knocking them down each taking it in turns and when it came to my sons turn he said your not allowed to knock them I don't want you to play .. so my son knocked them down anyway so he punched him in the face. 

I told him he shouldn't of knocked them down if someone doesn't want you to (even if they were excluding him from the game) .. and my friend literally just sat there and said nothing !? I left after that and seriously considering not going there with my son anymore as it's the same thing every time ... 

They had dinner at mine house and because my son sat on the sofa and his friend didn't want him to sit down he punched him in the back ... again she just sat there and said &#034;your punching for the wrong reasons&#034; 

I spoke to her on our own about the situation and she turned round and said well when they were 2 years old her son used to come home and tell her my son done this and that to him today and he let him and laugh ... so now it's his turn to go through this stage ? 

At 2 years old we never left them on there own so we would of seen ? Or if it happened while she was looking after them both why didn't she tell me then ? .. my child is no angel I'm not oblivious to his behaviour but how can she just dis miss this ? 

I know most replies would be stop seeing her but she's my childrens God parent and partners best friends wife so I would like to resolve this if possible. 

Any ideas how ? X

Miss W(13),"So my son is 8 years old &amp; is a very sensitive soul. Because I had him as a very young teenager, I was never in any of the 'cliques' that joined outside the school gates.

My son also seems to be in this situation. In his year, there are only around 5 boys and possibly around 12-15 girls. 3 out of the 5 boys are football mad, my son - however - is not. He enjoys football, but he isn't competitive like the others so he would rather play other games like tag or something with another little boy &amp; a few of the girls.

He is having quite a hard time at school. He came home a few months ago saying he had 'lost' his pencilcase. I mentioned this to the teacher because he needs it in class everyday. The teacher checked his drawer &amp; there was no sign. A few days later, one of the boys who has always been mean to my son 'found' the pencilcase 'under a table' (surely someone would have noticed it seeing as it was missing around 2 weeks). His gym bag has also gone missing, only to be found by the same boy, same thing with his school coat - again, same boy 'found it' he has mentioned before that they threaten to hide or break his possessions. 

I have attempted to speak to the teachers/headteacher but they all say nothing is going on. My son has said when he does decide to play football, this particular boy &amp; his friend like to trip my son up or make him feel small for missing a shot. Teachers said no such things happen during playtime, but other mums have passed by the school at playtime only to see the teachers gathered in a circle, talking, rather than watching the children.

I was bullied all through primary &amp; the last thing I wanted was for my son to suffer the same fate. I enrolled him in Kickboxing around 8 months ago in order to build his confidence because although it's a horrible thing to say, I feel like he's an easy target so at least as he gets older he can defend himself if these boys were ever to get physically nasty with him.

My son never puts anybody down, never ignores anyone, always lets everyone play. Yes he can be a little cheeky sometimes and can come up with some cheeky/sarcastic comments, but he would never make another child feel as useless &amp; singled out as the others make him feel. 

The way I'm currently feeling, I would gladly remove him from school &amp; pay for a home tutor for him, but I know it wouldn't be in his best interests education-wise. I just cannot see him be singled out &amp; made to feel like a piece of rubbish anymore. He's already an anxious child (I possibly mollycoddled a little too much as he was growing up) and this is making him become very introverted and I can't stand seeing my beautiful boy suffer.

Any ideas what I could do?

The other boys started to giggle. I lost my temper and shouted at the boy, threatening to call the police if a picture was put on social media. He swore at me so I told him that I hoped other children beat him up one day. I am feeling mortified with my actions as it was in front of other parents and children.

Dan28fxu,"This might end up being a long one so i apologise in advance. So i have a son aged 13 in year 8. He has access to some social media ie. Instagram. And also xbox live so he can play online with his friends. Said xbox is downstairs with the &#034;home pc&#034; so we can keep a general eye on things. 
So a while back my son has started with a bit of an attitude that we have put down to hormones. Have had a good old chat about hormones and how they can make you feel etc. 
Anyways onto the issues.....i noticed a while back on xbox live that there was a bit of &#034;banter&#034; going on and some innocent name calling here and there when ppl had done something wrong in the game etc but i soon noticed that a lot of these were aimed at my son on a regular basis. Im not saying my son didnt return any names but please bear with me. So there seemed to be alot aimed at my son and them saying that they didnt care what he said etc. What i felt to be more that &#034;banter&#034;. 
Had conversation with my son about differences between banter and knowing when a lo e has been crossed and that if he felt bad by any of it then he should.tell me straight away. 
More recently, said son left a comment on instagram that was inconsiderate and maybe hurtful to the intended person. This person went on a bit of a rant and handed out my sons instagram name to lots of ppl from a different school messaging him asking &#034;why are you bullying him&#034;, &#034;you will have to go through me first&#034; or &#034;ill kick s**t out of you&#034;. 
Now im not saying my son is innocent but i do believe his comment was unintentionally hurtful and wasnt meant the way it has been taken. 
Now 1)i think my son is a bully and 2)i think he may be being bullied buy he just cant see it. 
My son has a habit of not knowing when to stop sometimes and being a bit over the top which i hope will calm down with maturity. 
Im not sure what to do here as he has got alot of grief from ppl he doesnt know about 1 comment (said people have now been blocked), yet it seems his &#034;friends&#034; can say whatever they want to him yet they are not bullies and my son is.

liz57zfi,"Hiya everyone, sorry this is going to be pretty long.

A few months ago my previous landlord put my flat up for auction as well as his shop down stairs, I didn't even know about it till the sign went outside my window it got sold to this older woman at the auction.

She didn't complete it until a week ago and was demanding rent of me from when she first put the deposit down on it I have my rent paid for me as I have 3 children 4 year old 2 year old and 10 months.

She didn't like the fact the council are only paying her from when she completed it and my old landlord the other two months since then she has been awful trying to let herself in my flat saying she owns the building and she can do as she wishes and I'm only here on her good graces also I don't even pay the rent the council do so I'm no better than a squatter.

She has also given her manager of the shop my flat key ( who is a convicted perv ) where you enter my flat my front door is made of glass my kitchen windows you can see right through she says I have no say in it if she wants to come up.

Yesterday she left my gate open downstairs where I keep my push chairs and my kids bikes and stuff there is no need for her to enter the gate but according to her I have no right to keep anything down there not even my wheelie bins so I have to drag them up and down the stairs I confronted her not in a nasty way just wanted to get my point across all I asked her is if she came upstairs and wanted to come in not to just let herself in give me some notice I have 3 little kids and I can't go to the loo without them thinking it's a spectating sport and my loo is opposite the front door she told my to stop acting like a baby and called me a b***h I also said I didn't like the idea of a bloke who is a convicted pervert the have a key to my front door she told me so shut my f-ing mouth then told me I'm a **** mother for not working (I have worked since I was 16 I'm now 27 I stopped when I had my children until my youngest is old enough to go to play group) she's threatened to call ss on me I have the kids dad stay a few night a week to spend time with them she said she is forbidding me from having visitors and she will call benefits and say I'm cheating them which I am not at all.

This afternoon the same bloke who works for her pulled the kids dad aside and told him he's going to call the police for him coz he's trespassing on her property went to go hit him bearing in mind this bloke is huge up and out so I went down there after and she continued to call me a f-ing ***** I'm living here for free and I'm a weak little girl coz I got upset when she told me she's evicting me and I should put the kids in care for their sake.

Sent from my GT-I9300 using Netmums mobile appHiya everyone, sorry this is going to be pretty long.A few months ago my previous landlord put my flat up for auction as well as his shop down stairs, I didn't even know about it till the sign went outside my window it got sold to this older woman at the auction.She didn't complete it until a week ago and was demanding rent of me from when she first put the deposit down on it I have my rent paid for me as I have 3 children 4 year old 2 year old and 10 months.She didn't like the fact the council are only paying her from when she completed it and my old landlord the other two months since then she has been awful trying to let herself in my flat saying she owns the building and she can do as she wishes and I'm only here on her good graces also I don't even pay the rent the council do so I'm no better than a squatter.She has also given her manager of the shop my flat key ( who is a convicted perv ) where you enter my flat my front door is made of glass my kitchen windows you can see right through she says I have no say in it if she wants to come up.Yesterday she left my gate open downstairs where I keep my push chairs and my kids bikes and stuff there is no need for her to enter the gate but according to her I have no right to keep anything down there not even my wheelie bins so I have to drag them up and down the stairs I confronted her not in a nasty way just wanted to get my point across all I asked her is if she came upstairs and wanted to come in not to just let herself in give me some notice I have 3 little kids and I can't go to the loo without them thinking it's a spectating sport and my loo is opposite the front door she told my to stop acting like a baby and called me a b***h I also said I didn't like the idea of a bloke who is a convicted pervert the have a key to my front door she told me so shut my f-ing mouth then told me I'm a **** mother for not working (I have worked since I was 16 I'm now 27 I stopped when I had my children until my youngest is old enough to go to play group) she's threatened to call ss on me I have the kids dad stay a few night a week to spend time with them she said she is forbidding me from having visitors and she will call benefits and say I'm cheating them which I am not at all.This afternoon the same bloke who works for her pulled the kids dad aside and told him he's going to call the police for him coz he's trespassing on her property went to go hit him bearing in mind this bloke is huge up and out so I went down there after and she continued to call me a f-ing ***** I'm living here for free and I'm a weak little girl coz I got upset when she told me she's evicting me and I should put the kids in care for their sake.

Emm00fbx,"I really must apologise - I'm new here and didn't know where to post my worries and get your advice and help!

My son (12), has been picked on repeatedly by the same child in school since year 7 (he's now year 8). He was calling my child 'fat' and just general horrible taunts. I've talked to teachers and been to the school but there has been no resolution.

My son has now lost a LOT of weight to the point where family and friends have commented. 

I have just got off the phone to the school as thefe was an 'incident' earlier where this boy moved the seat from under my son. 
My child has thrown the chair in anger and now his tormentor is in A&amp;E to await xray results.
i'm really upset that my child has done this. I do not condone such an attack. The school have said it's all on CCTV that this ither boy started the incident but it's serious as he come off hurt.

I'm worried that my son's behaviour will lead to police involvement/suspension. I got upset with the school and asked why they didn't do anything before the situation got out of control. All he said was 'I'm aware of tensions between them. I think this needs resolving'. I have tried for months to get something done but now my son looks like the bully. 

The school have put a counsellor in place at the start of term and my child sees him once a week to deal with the effects bullying has had on him. He has observed my son without him knowing and has described him as 'a model student in class'. I know my child is not perfect but he is certainly not a thug or bully and now he's had enough of the taunting and retaliated he could be in a lot of trouble.

I'm at my witts end! Has anybody been through similar or have any advice please?

anY54ztg,"My daughter who is 12 and just gone into year 8 is being bullied in school. The first occasion was a boy in her class called her a terrorist and made comments about bombs. This was dealt with by the school.

My husband is Indian and I am from the UK. We are a non religious family who believe like most of the families in the UK just to be kind to everyone.

Yesterday my husband went to pick my daughter up from school after a football match she was playing in. As they were driving out the school gates a group of boys walked in front of the car and looked in through the windscreen and shouted Alla Akbah in an aggressive manner and made comments about jihadists. My husband was so shocked and my daughter mortified.

He reversed the car and asked the group of boys what was said as he wanted to be sure he had heard right, the culprit wouldn't make eye contact but one of his friends said sorry. My hubby is the most chilled out kind dude ever, so left and came home and told me what happened. 

My daughter told us not to worry about it, people (including year 11's) say this and shout comments to her in the corridor and playground all the time.

I am horrified and upset. I cannot believe she is being singled out like this, it must be awful. I feel pretty powerless
and want to protect her from this. 

My husband went up and spoke to the head this morning and told him that he needs to crack down on this in school, these are kids of our future and to be so young and be brave and confident enough to stop a car to abuse and adult and a child is a scary thought.

I find it hard to give her coping mechanisms for this, I have never experienced it myself and don't know what it feels like. I just want to handle it properly.

My daughter and I are chalk and cheese. She is very academic, sporty and has a large group of friends thankfully and tends to be more relaxed. I am more reactive and a bull in a china shop. hence hubby said this morning he would speak to head in a calm manner:)

does anyone have any advice or encountered anything similar?

It's awful because she won't let go and it will usually take me and her mum a couple of minutes to prise her fingers open, leaving her with clumps of my daughters hair in her fists.

From what my friend has told me, she can't even let her daughter out of the pushchair in town because if she sees another child nearby will make a beeline for them for no other reason than to hurt them in some way.

He said he wouldnt like it and would feel sad. I said why dont you help the little boy and try to be his friend or if not to stay away from him. The boy in question is two year older than him and is in his brothers class. Today he punched the same boy and said he liked bullying....i am at a loss! What have i done wrong?

Lou75vmj,"Hi everyone..I've never written on here before but I am really struggling with my 5 year olds behaviour at the moment and need some advice.

He has always been a very boisterous boy and very demanding of attention. I split up with his dad just before he turned 3 and had a lot of problems with his behaviour after that which I put down to the result of the split, Us having to leave our home and his dad not moving his new girlfriend in within weeks of us leaving and generally making life difficult for us in that first few months after the split. 

I have since worked really hard to build up my business and a stable home for me and my little boy..he sees his dad weekly and things are civil between us now. But his behaviour seems to be getting worse.

Basically since the start of the summer holidays he has been a total nightmare, aggressive, physically violent towards me and my mum, unruly, answering back, throwing things, breaking things etc..usually as a result of being told 'no'. I took him away for 10 nights with my mum and his behaviour was horrendous for most of the holiday, he kicked off in the plane, but my mum, bit me. I was in tears twice, he threatened me with a glass bottle..it just goes on and on.

He has settled down slightly since being back at school but we have just been away for a few days with a friend and her little boy (for the 3rd year running) and he has bullied her little boy for most of the weekend, pushing him over, being rough with him, snatching toys off him, scratching him etc. I have been so upset and sat in tears the whole night thinking what have I done so wrong..feel like a failure of a mother, like I can't control him. And I'm getting to the point where I don't want to go out with friends and their children in case it happens again.

On the other hand he is extremely bright and clever, he does brilliant at school, he is popular, he goes to his dad's on a weekend and generally behaves well for them. It just seems to be me who cannot control him! I feel so alone and want to help him but I just don't know where to start. I have tried reward charts, time outs, taking things away, ignoring bad behaviour etc. I have asked for help from the health visitor and school nurse before too but still the problem remains. And the aggression is getting worse. He is strong and hurts me when he goes off on one..I know I need to nip this in the bud before he gets much bigger. 

Sorry for the massive rant. Any advice would be much appreciated x

Also to say I do a lot with him..we go swimming, kickboxing, lots of walks and quality time together etc too but he seems to spiral when the whole attention isn't on him..e.g when we are with other people and this is usually when he will have a meltdown. Or become very loud and disruptive so I'm unable to have a conversation with anyone who we are with.Hi everyone..I've never written on here before but I am really struggling with my 5 year olds behaviour at the moment and need some advice.He has always been a very boisterous boy and very demanding of attention.

laura m(920),"Hi fellow netmummies, 

as i write this my son in sat the other side of the sofa after another argument and i just dont know where to turn anymore. 

my son is nearly 13, he is quite a quiet boy and is very sensitive, from about 8 years old he suffered from bullying which resulted in me moving him to 3 different primary schools. When we moved him to the last school it was a private school in a different area to where we live, i also have a 10 year old who has unfortunately had to move schools as well each time. The children were happy in the private school. 

back last summer we ended up moving the children back to local schools due to the financial commitment and also because the travelling back and for was getting hard work. 

well my daughter moved to a primary school and is so happy - she is currently in year 5 and my son moved into year 8 of a high school. 

my son has been bullied bad since moving him and i am just stuck on what to do now....:hmmm:
things got quite bad so i ended up a couple of Weeks ago writing to the council and getting him took off the school register to home school him. I have since spoken to the private school and they are able to both return back in sept. 

this obviously means my daughter leaving the school she is settled in, us having to pay for the school again and having to travel everyday. school is an hour away. 

Now i know my son has been through the mill over the years but i just cant handle his behavior anymore he is tearing our family apart. the thought of paying to send him to school when he treats me and his dad dirt drives me mad. 
We recently went on holiday which we couldn't really afford and he just wrecked it with the way he was acting. its really hard to explain his behavior without it sounding minimal to others. for instant - i have given him some work to do at home just simple things like writing a story and maths and he just doesn't put any effort in. literally he wrote 3 lines for the story and it didn't even make sense, his handwriting was awful and he is more than capable. when i was telling him off he just laughed at me and thought it was funny.

he has never ever been able to mix with children well and ive tried encouraging him to attend our local church youth group and all he has done about it is moan and he knows all the children are lovely. yet then he will sit there and cry saying he has no friends. i cant win with him. 

i ask him to help around the house and he never does it right - its like he does it wrong to get out of it. his younger sister the 10 year old always helps us with our 2 year old and he just sits there. i will ask him to get dressed and i will tell him what to put on and he picks something else more likely 9 times out of 10 something that doesn't fit. 
he talks to us with attitude and all we try and do it our best by him, what do i do ? my husband was crying the other morning as he said he cant handle him anymore - he thinks it just all gone on too long and nothing ever changes. its tearing our family apart. we've literally had issue after issue since he was about 8. 
he will have a bath, forget his clothes and come out dripping water over the floor in our lounge and leave it wet and not think about our 2 year old falling - we've had so many accidents in the house caused through him and afterwards he just says he didn't think i know these might not sound major but these are just some examples but literally something happens every 20 mins in the house and we never go a day without arguing. 

i know it may sound daft but its like whatever we say doesn't register with him - he has had assessments before and passed them all as i wasn't sure everything was right and he has never had academic problems in school. the only way i can describe him is hes like a 5 year old in a 13 year old body. 

i love him dearly and every time we tell him off i get so upset and sad, i just want him to be happy. i want him to realise he must make an effort and change his ways. 

what do i do? any ideas i would be so so grateful. this sounds really bad but its getting to the point where my husband and me will end up splitting up because the arguments are tearing us all apart.

She's just started reception class and had her first week which went really well, we're into the second week and she has started hitting. There's been three incidents, she's hot two little boys and then her teacher. I had the same type of behaviour when she was in nursery too. I have tried all sorts, I've tried speaking with her, taking toys away, time out, reward incentives. This kid has an answer for everything and the attitude she gives me is out of this world. Most people giggle when I tell them what she's like but it's not funny. I don't know what to do anymore and I'm so embarrassed up at the school, I keep getting called in everytime I pick her up and the next day I make her apologise to the boys and teacher.

There's been three incidents, she's hot two little boys and then her teacher. I had the same type of behaviour when she was in nursery too. I have tried all sorts, I've tried speaking with her, taking toys away, time out, reward incentives. This kid has an answer for everything and the attitude she gives me is out of this world. Most people giggle when I tell them what she's like but it's not funny. I don't know what to do anymore and I'm so embarrassed up at the school, I keep getting called in everytime I pick her up and the next day I make her apologise to the boys and teacher. It's horrible being the parent of the school bully.......",3,"1,521", 14-09-2016 at 2.10PM

Gin27jwu,"hello...need some advice on an on going problem.

i am a mother of 2...both with ASD...one now grown up and the other turning 5...i have been around lots of children over the years with all sorts of learning conditions...so i kinda know a little more than most i've met.

within the last year i have had to deal with my youngest &#034;self harming&#034; himself...(biting himself/beating his head on the ground/hitting himself with what ever is in his hand etc...) all the usual frustration stuff that scares a parent to death...we even got to the point of believing our little one had a more...how do i put this?...a little more &#034;complex&#034; a problem than just ASD...turned out to be a speach problem (phew!)

anyway...a few months ago he began attacking the nursery staff, his big brother and then (worst of all) the other children.......took the time to figure out where/what was going on.

there was no violence at home...i even interrogated our eldest...looked to the tv/movies/games etc...nothing

began looking into his needs/wants to see if there was something i was missing...nothing

began looking outside the home...only one place....the nursery...so i did what any mother would do and began asking questions...not the staff but my child

one child within the group was hurting him...big kid too, but i also knew he had &#034;difficulties&#034;...a little more than my boys.

how about this one...i told the nursery and they agreed there where problems with said child...i asked for his condition and both the ladies looked at eachother and informed me there was none...and practically cringed when i asked if the child was in the process via Drs/specialists etc...not my business you may well say...but i can forgive a child and feel sympathy for struggling parents and try to teach my boy to help with said child......seems the parents are oblivious or ignorant to what is more than obvious to everyone else!!!....why do parents let a child do without the help they need??? i just don't understand people sometimes.

anyway, i took my boy out for 2 weeks...rectified his behaviour...(a good grounding ie, no toys, fav tv, treats etc...boot camp)...then arranged for him to be at home on the days the boy was there...worked a treat.

i punished my little boy because of someone else's bad parenting...plus still paying the nursery for the pleasure!...but still it worked and all the staff commented on the turn around in him...great couple of months.

last week i pulled up and guess who was arriving?...yep...less than a week and my boy has bitten and beaten his big brother again...he has also started acting in a fashion of bashing his toys rather than playing with them....he says (the boy who i can not name) does this...and he is also beating my boy again.

the nursery knows this child has problems...the parents are doing nothing about it...my boy and others are being beaten and taught all the wrong behaviour (this boy stands a foot taller than all of them and tends to lead the play)and i spent the better part of a month checking and punishing my son....for nothing.

are our hands truly tied or can something be done??? this boy has now a new sibling (no it is not the cause...the child imo has ADHD or worse, sadly...my aunt is brain damaged)...he is extremely aggressive and violent...was thinking of calling in the social services myself...what if the baby gets hurt?...what are the laws and the nursery's responsibilities...and i personally don't want my son near this boy...one of the staff let it slip that this has been going on for 3 yrs or more with this boy and the nursery are very aware of it.

don't know what to do or who to blame...or who should be doing what...not looking for advise but laws and if the nursery can/should do more.

Rac72lvo,"Hi 
I am new to this site, I always read posts but never posted anything until now. 

I have a problem and I really don't know how to deal with it. 
My daughter is 4 and starting school this year. She is the most lovely sweetest girl you can ever meet but I have noticed that she is struggling forming friendships amongst her peers. 

When she goes to nursery all her friends ignore her and I have seen this myself. My daughter is always excited to see everyone in school but yet when she approaches them they all run away from her. I've watched her follow her friends round the play ground and they treat her like she is invisible but yet she keeps trying and following them around. 

Recently she was invited to a party from her nursery when she got there she had no acknowledgment from any of the other children and therefore sat on her own looking lost throughout the whole party. One child also pushed her away and the child's parent witnessed this and didn't do or say anything which I thought was wrong. I also feel my daughter hasn't learned the skill of sticking up for herself yet as yet as at the party she was in the queue for ice cream and one of the girls who my daughter tries to play with told her to move out of her position and get to the back of he queue, my daughter listened to her and lost her place and stood at the back of the queue crying. This was heartbreaking for me to watched and I ended up shouting st her and told her to get back in her position the queue, it was sheer frustration as I could see how she was being treated and now but i am wracked with guilt as its not her fault. 

The only explanation I can think why this is happening is my daughter is too advanced for the children she hangs around with. My daughter is he oldest in the class and most of her friends are the youngest in the class so there is nearly a year difference and that could be why she is not connecting with them on her level and I am just hoping things will change. 

As school is approaching in September
Any advice would be helpful.

Ano67wwt,"Hi there,

I was wondering if you could please give me some advice.

My 9 year old daughter is best friends with two other girls in her class. A few years ago, the school got involved with bullying, as a teacher witnessed, in the playground, these two girls physically hurting my daughter. I'd been telling the teachers on and off for about 18 months that there was a problem, but they only eventually intervened when they saw it become physical. 

Before the bullying became physical, I'd even tried speaking to the other parents about it. One was very helpful and understanding, but the other went straight to the school, but I'm glad the school eventually dealt with it.

Fortunately, my daughter and these same girls get on really well now.

Unfortunately, the two other girls parents arrange for their daughters to do lots of after school activities with each other, but my daughter is left out.

This really upsets my daughter, who sees these two girls as her best friends. My daughter has chosen her friends, not me. Yet these girls mothers organise activities which exclude my daughter. I feel that my daughter is being excluded because the parents don't like me.

These are the activities to date that my daughter has not been asked to participate in. Dancing, horse riding, guitar lessons and now ice skating.

My daughter became so upset about her two friends always doing clubs together that in the end I asked one of the parents if it's OK for my daughter to join in the dancing group. My daughter now goes there and thoroughly enjoys it.

She does get invited to play at one of the friends houses quite often, but the other girls parent has only invited my daughter round once in four years. Still, I see this as progress. These are my daughters friends.

My daughter loves these girls, and they do appear to get on really well now, but it breaks mine and my daughters hearts when again, a club is organised and no one thinks to ask my daughter.


I am really tired of this exclusion. I really feel like confronting these parents, but feel that it would damage my daughters relationships even further.

Has anyone get any insight into this situation? I feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place, as my daughter obviously wants to do extracurricular activities with these girls, but the parents still exclude her to a large degree.Hi there,I was wondering if you could please give me some advice.My 9 year old daughter is best friends with two other girls in her class.  A few years ago, the school got involved with bullying, as a teacher witnessed, in the playground, these two girls physically hurting my daughter.  I'd been telling the teachers on and off for about 18 months that there was a problem, but they only eventually intervened when they saw it become physical.  Before the bullying became physical, I'd even tried speaking to the other parents about it.  One was very helpful and understanding, but the other went straight to the school, but I'm glad the school eventually dealt with it.Fortunately, my daughter and these same girls get on really well now.Unfortunately, the two other girls parents arrange for their daughters to do lots of after school activities with each other, but my daughter is left out.This really upsets my daughter, who sees these two girls as her best friends.  My daughter has chosen her friends, not me.  Yet these girls mothers organise activities which exclude my daughter.  I feel that my daughter is being excluded because the parents don't like me.These are the activities to date that my daughter has not been asked to participate in.  Dancing, horse riding, guitar lessons and now ice skating.My daughter became so upset about her two friends always doing clubs together that in the end I asked one of the parents if it's OK for my daughter to join in the dancing group.  My daughter now goes there and thoroughly enjoys it.She does get invited to play at one of the friends houses quite often, but the other girls parent has only invited my daughter round once in four years.  Still, I see this as progress.  These are my daughters friends.My daughter loves these girls, and they do appear to get on really well now, but it breaks mine and my daughters hearts when again, a club is organised and no one thinks to ask my daughter.I am really tired of this exclusion.  I really feel like confronting these parents, but feel that it would damage my daughters relationships even further.Has anyone get any insight into this situation?  I feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place, as my daughter obviously wants to do extracurricular activities with these girls, but the parents still exclude her to a large degree.",3,"5,241", 14-06-2016 at 5.01AM

Emma C(753),"My son aged 8 has had ongoing issue at school. His behaviour can be a challenge, been to CAMHS and although ticked alot of boxes for ASD not enough for a diagnosis. Emotionally he struggles and has anxiety problems. 
School not overly supportive, they are good at saying right thing but its never followed through with regard to support for my son. 
One boy aged 10, known to be of concern to school for bullying amongst other things, is saying things to my son~swearing, threats, hitting. Other day my son was outside staff room for talking in class, other boy also placed there, its unclear what happened but from sounds of it my son called him a name other boy retaliated by nipping his back (bruising visable) and punching him in the stomach causing my son to cry. Not informed by staff, son told his dad at home. Partner later saw said boy and warned him off telling him to stay away. Next day asked for HT to contact us but he didn't do this so I went to see him. Turns out boy gone into school said partner and son have shouted and sworn at him and threatened him harm, which is not true, we dont swear much esp not infront of the children. Thought I had sorted it with HT then when I get home the police turn up. HT has reported partner to the police, without even talking to us. The other boy has not stopped and said to my son he needs to watch out as his dad will beat us all up and is going to put our Windows through. HT said if my son didnt name call then this wouldn't happen. At a total loss with what to do or why to get advice :-(My son aged 8 has had ongoing issue at school. His behaviour can be a challenge, been to CAMHS and although ticked alot of boxes for ASD not enough for a diagnosis. Emotionally he struggles and has anxiety problems. School not overly supportive, they are good at saying right thing but its never followed through with regard to support for my son. One boy aged 10, known to be of concern to school for bullying amongst other things, is saying things to my son~swearing, threats, hitting.

Hel91ybo,"My dd is 7 years old and currently best friends with a girl in her class. Over the past year I have had my dd coming home upset because her so called best friend is making the other girls run away from her. I've tried my best to help the situation, having the best friend round for play dates and some of the other girls but I've now had enough.

There was a school trip where my dd was told by her best friend not to join in with her and the other girls and she was left on her own for the duration of the trip.

Her best friends mother never invites my dd for play dates but will happily take other children and send her child to me.

What do I do?

Jo 56pvv,"Hi,

I have a 9 year old boy who is having problems with a boy in his class and also siblings. We have had a number of incidents where my son has been hit in the face twice by the younger sibling in school, and injured by the boy with a stick. 

When I had a polite word about this with the parents, they did not react well and tried to accuse my son of bullying. I was hoping that they may discuss with their children, but they simply take offence and are quite aggressive. I have now learnt that this is a family that is best avoided.

The problem is that the boy constantly kicks my boys bike, ruins his play with friends, and swears at him. He also continues to knock at our door to ask to play! 

I am not sure how to deal with this. I believe other families have had issues too, but I can't see the school are doing anything to help. 

Any advice please?Hi,I have a 9 year old boy who is having problems with a boy in his class and also siblings.

Jul83tyv,"Dear mums/dads,
I need some support and advice on what to do about bullying. My daughter is 7 years old and last Friday, only by a chance I found out that she has been bullied by another girl from year above. I witnessed it my self as I was walking behind my daughter a girl came up to her and put her face very close to my daughters face. It felt like she was trying to intimidate my daughter and my daughter did look like she was scared of her. At first I thought they were just talking, but after asking my daughter she said she doesn't even know the girl's name and that this girl does this to her for a long time and that she (my daughter) doesn't like it at all. I was so upset about it and not only that it started so early when kids supposed to be innocent and not trying to upset or hurt someone, I was upset that my daughter has been going through this with this girl for more than a year now and I am upset that my little girl didn't come to me and told me about this before. That she felt this way for a long time and kept it to herself. I don't know what to do about this situation, but I also don't know how to help my daughter to be more open with me and talk to me when she feels this way. Any help and advice will be very appreciated. Thank you!Dear mums/dads,I need some support and advice on what to do about bullying.

lisa f(24),"My 7 year old had a girl in his class who has always been 'highly strung'. She will always sulk &amp; lash out if she doesn't get her way. She is bossy towards the other children and cries if she loses at anything. I see this with my own eyes, especially at parties and when in the park etc. My son regularly tells me tails about what she has been up to in class as well. But at the end of the day she is a little girl &amp; Ive never been too bothered. She calls my son her best friend (along with 2 other boys). She always plays with the boys and takes over their games. My son doesn't really mind this. 
Occasionally the boys want to play a game by themselves &amp; so she will go and tell the teacher or dinner lady that the boys are being unkind, so they get into trouble. 
She will 'tell' on other children all the time (so my son tells me &amp; my friend who used to be a parent helper - she stopped being a parent helper in the class as she was frustrated by this child's behaviour). The child once told the teacher that my son had said a swear word (my son had been talking about a fox!!??). At that time he didn't even know what she meant by swear word. 
Today I saw 1st hand how she can behave. At a party shouting at my son, again saying he had said a swear word (he still doesn't know any). He was so distressed. She was constantly shouting at him &amp; saying she hated him (because he won at a game). I approached the mum as my son asked me to. I just said in a lighthearted way that the girl had been saying a few hurtful things to my son, but achknowledged my son is no saint. She said she didn't care, she was ignoring her and nobody is perfect. Another mum then said ' they are at a very emotional age (suggesting my son was over reacting). As we left she shouted so everyone could hear from her mums car window &#034;I hate u, I hate u...!!!! The mum just laughed. 
My son has remained sad all afternoon and has opened up to me about many other things the girl does at school. He said she upsets him at playtimes when he just wants to play with his friends. If he ignored her, she goes and 'tells'. This again gets him into trouble. 
My son is a sensitive soul. He is so innocent &amp; doesn't understand why she behaved like this. 
I can't tell though if this girl is bullying him or if she had behavioural problems. If I approach the school what can they do? I can't ask that they stop her playing with him at play times. And I'm sure I don't need to point out her behaviour as I'm sure they already know. 
I don't know what to do. I've never seen him so sad about another child's behaviours.

My son (4) is being bullied at preschool and I want to address it with the teachers tomorrow in more depth than our 10 minute conversation last Thursday. 
I want to go armed with the right information. I know that by law schools must have an anti bullying policy in place; does anyone know if this applies to preschools too?

Hel66cqq,"My son has come home on Friday to tell me that whilst sat on a chair in the playground a child in his class has put a skipping rope around his neck &amp; pulled it back. My son managed to pull his arms through so the rope was round his waist, where the rope was then pulled back again. My son grabbed the rope &amp; discarded it. The other child has then sat on his knee, my son has told him to get off which he did &amp; then sat on the arm of the chair elbowing my son. Another child, has stood &amp; watched this happen, he is very good friends with the child doing the rope pulling etc. My son &amp; this child have never really got on, they have always clashed. The children are 10yrs. Whilst I know I am biased to defend my child, my son is very young minded, naive, lacks self esteem &amp; is sensitive in fact very overly sensitive. The other child is old headed, confident &amp; basically is able to run rings round my son. I will be contacting the head mistress tomorrow about the incident. I am well aware that there will be another side to the story, &amp; may well be things my son has told me. This is not the first incident with this child. At the beginning of the previous class year the child told me son he would show him a magic trick. He told him to lay on his back in the playground &amp; put his legs in the air, he then kicked him in the privates in front on other children. A teacher (who is no longer at the school) witnessed what had happened, called both boys in and made the child apologise to my son. I was never told about this incident, my son told me about it weeks after it happened. As it had been dealt with I left it there, ever since then I have been kicking myself that I did not contact the school to ask why I was not told what had happened. I will be mentioning it tomorrow! I am basically posting this to ask advice on how to approach the Head teacher? Am I over reacting that I think the sitting in knee part is intimidating behaviour? I would also want the other parents consulted on what happened. I am also concerned that they will question the child who observed the incident (who helped get the skipping rope ready) &amp; it will be a case of 2 stories against 2, I am assuming he will defend his friend &amp; my son will be made to look like he is lying.

Oia522z,"Hey everyone, my son is 8 and goes to a normal school, he has autism and a TA.

He's always adored school, my sons a real pleaser and a happy chappy.

Were a military family and moved to Dorset a year and a half ago and he attends school on camp.

When he started hee he struggled making friends bur school assured me they were working hard to help him with that.

Until December happened...

My son came home and told me a child had punched him. I instantly called school and spoke to his teacher and the head. They said they'd handle it.

Then he tripped my son up outside and sat on his back causing him a swollen ankle and a limp. I did the same again and they said they'd call me on Monday.

They said they'd sat both boys down with the school counceller and told them to stay away from each other and told me his TA would supervise play time for a while.

Then he comes home upset saying he has no friends and no one wants to play with him. I call school who don't seem to know about this and say they'll buddie him with an older boy as older kids seem more tolerent of his needs.

Then he comes home a few days ago saying that this kid has once again been dragging him around by his jumper and pushing him out of the line as they queue up to go back inside.

I've had enough now, my kid no longer wants to go to school. He's a fragile soul at the best of times. 

What i want to know is - what is the process within primary schools?

I have no idea if this kids parents even know what he's doing!!

Jill B(254),"Please please help or advise?

My son aged 12 (nearly 13) has been bullied since going up to senior school and I have been up and down the school for the past 3yrs. Things seem to have settled down for the last 3mths which has been a big relief but yesterday my son came home in tears and this is what happened:

My son was bullied, assaulted and suffered criminal damage not to mention the psychological stress this has caused him. From the statement made by my son and from what the school have said to me today I understand that my son was with a group of boys on the top field at lunch time. The boys (who have bullied my son constantly on and off for 3yrs) bullied him into ripping a button off his shirt to which he did. He did this due to peer pressure, bullying and to try and stay in with the so called in crowd, unfortunately this is something children and adults do in order to feel wanted, liked and hopefully stop the bullying (its a known fact). So yes my son did rip one button off his shirt but was then set on? Attacked? not sure what word to use but other boys then ripped the rest of the buttons off his shirt which also resulted in ripping his shirt, the top button was harder to remove so one of the boys produced a pen knife, put it to Sams neck and cut the button off. They then preceded to spray and cover Sams jumper in deodorant and also his backside. 

The school got back to me today to say that after their investigations they have suspended the boy who had the pen knife for 3 days. 

Yes thats it!!!!! No offer of replacing the cost of my sons shirt, no apology, nothing to say how they are going to keep my son safe in school in the future, absolutely nothing! When I argued that this was assault the assistant head said it was not as the pen knife was not used to harm my son!!!! When I argued that I thought it was illegal for children to carry weapons in their bags he argued back as said because the blade is less then 3in long its not classed as a weapon????

Does anyone think this is right???? I am absolutely gutted, devastated and frightened for my son, in fact I rang the police and guess what.........they dont want to know either and said the school have more powers then them and that the pen knife used is not a weapon, not illegal etc etc

Am I going completely mad???? after everything that has happened in schools recently with teachers being stabbed I thought incidents like this would be taken very seriously, as I see it as assault and criminal damage.

I have complained to police and the officer I spoke to day who was utterly rude to me, I am speaking to his line manager tomorrow but I dont hold any any hope as the other person I spoke to today said that then pen knife used is not a weapon and was not used as a weapon??? Even thou it was put to my sons neck to cut off a button?

Any advise would be greatly appreciated.Please please help or advise?My son aged 12 (nearly 13) has been bullied since going up to senior school and I have been up and down the school for the past 3yrs.  Things seem to have settled down for the last 3mths which has been a big relief but yesterday my son came home in tears and this is what happened:My son was bullied, assaulted and suffered criminal damage not to mention the psychological stress this has caused him.  From the statement made by my son and from what the school have said to me today I understand that my son  was with a group of boys on the top field at lunch time.  The boys (who have bullied my son constantly on and off for 3yrs) bullied him into ripping a button off his shirt to which he did.  He did this due to peer pressure, bullying and to try and stay in with the so called in crowd, unfortunately this is something children and adults do in order to feel wanted, liked and hopefully stop the bullying (its a known fact).  So yes my son did rip one button off his shirt but was then set on?

I feel incredibly sad and have been in tears, I'm not sure what to do, school said it was just unfortunate how he had fell and my son had never ever shown anger or agression to any other child. What's going to happen to my son at school? What do I say to the parents when I see them at school next? I don't feel I can properly tell my son off because he's been pushed to the edge of his tether with bullying I have sat down and said its very serious and he should never do this again.

Bibi C,"My ds looks up to his cousin (boys age 9 and 17 yo respectively). When we visit their house, they spend lots of time sitting in bedroom playing computer games. When we go out for walks, they break away from the adult group and inevitably something happens which we have to sort out. 9 yo son does antagonise, playing tig or something, then 17 (nearly 18) yo cousin retaliates. Yesterday, I got back to find my son crying hiding behind a chair in a room on his own. My sil said he came in fine, burst into tears when spoken to, ran off. No one went to him. I fojbd him when I got in, was told by ds they had been chasing each other whacking sticks, the 17 yo had scared him by pinning him against his body with one hand and closing his other hand against his nose and mouth to block his breathing, then thrown to the ground. When asked, the 17 yo claimed not to know about anything. My dd (5 yo) was with them and said that the 17 yo had had his hand against younger ones face. 17 yo claimed he hadn't... then continued to say he did but not so as to block his breathing. My son was beside himself crying in another room and refused to come out from behind a chair. Numerous games over-powering the 9 yo by the 17 yo have occurred over the years, for instance, abandoning youngster on a walk in a forest (5yo then), causing him to be very scared and alone, running then casually walking to us making it look as if younger one got himself lost. Younger one goes back to wanting to be with the 17 yo, then something inevitably happens again when there's no adult in situ. The 17 yo spends a lot of time on his computer, shows little empathy. We have to stay there when visiting grandma as we live 80 miles away. Suffocating and intent to cause harm is assault. Younger one was clearly left frightened. But then won't stay away from older one. What would you do? My son expects me to step in when these things happen. It is causing a lot of awkwardness in the family.

Kal05,"Hello all. I hope you can help. My youngest two children are at primary school and have told me today that a member of the dinner duty staff has been bullying them and other children. 

She told my child she didn't want to see his 'ugly little face' again and was extremely aggressive in her manner. My daughter also told me that a couple of months ago, she punched her in the back. I'm alarmed that my children are scared to tell me when they are having problems at school.
They have never been scared to to tell myself or my wife about anything before. They have also told me that teachers ignore children when they try &amp; bring up bullying and are told to 'sort it out themselves.'

There have been a number of bullying incidents against my children and every time I speak to the Head, she hides behind false assurances and apologies, assuring me that the problem will be sorted out. 

This dinner lady, a disgusting excuse for a human being, was dismissed some months ago for calling a child a b****. Apparently, she begged for her job back and was reinstated.

There is a definite problem with bullying in the school, which wasn't the case when my children started there, after we moved to the area. It was rated as outstanding and we made an informed decision about sending our children there.

The Head gave me the old chestnut, 'this hasn't happened before'. My mother &amp; sister are both teachers and have told me that unfortunately some teachers will use this line so the school doesn't get a bad rep. Other parents have told me of numerous occasions where their children have been bullied regularly so I know what she's saying is just bull.

I've had enough of their laissez-faire, inept attitude and I am seriously considering reporting this matter to the Police. I have zero confidence in the staff at the school and the Head. Should I go ahead and report this?

My son age 7 seems to be a constant target for the bullies. It is a horrible situation to be in, and I am pulling my own hair out. Yesterday, he was held upside down and then dropped onto the concrete in the playground!!!!!! A friend of my sons ran and told a dinner lady who did absolutely nothing. She didn't go and see if my son was ok, she didn't speak to the bully, and she didn't report the incident.
I have spoken to the teachers, from reception when it first started, through to year 2, which is now in. I have spoken and written to the Headteacher, pointed out the school's policy etc etc, and yet still it carries on.
I have practically begged my son to stick up for himself, I don't mean violence or anything, just shout, yell, anything to try and stop the little sods from hurting him. My son just won't do anything, other than say 'stop''don't do that', and tell the teachers. He is doing exactly what the school say to do!!!
Yesterday was the last straw for me, (it has been quiet since November). I spoke to my son's teacher, (who didn't seem that interested or concerned to be honest), I spoke to the older child (bully) teacher, who was absolutely shocked and assured me she would deal with it straightaway.
One of the other Mums i spoke to this morning told me that I am making things worse by continously going in when it happens, and that my son should stick up for himself. Don't get me wrong, he has a big mouth on him, but he doesn't use it for the bullies!
How can I be making it worse??????? This is my little lad of 7, with only me to protect him.

rachael s(172),"Hi

I have twin boys who are in year 2 but separate classes. We have had issues in the past with one of our boys who is a big character and is probably 20 decibels louder at times than most children and can have a silly head on during most of the day. We have tried to have him assessed but the only thing they found was his behaviour can sometimes be effected if he is hungry. On the other hand he is the most loving little boy who wants to be friend with everyone and doesn't have the social skills he needs to deal with certain situations and never speaks badly of anyone.

Anyway during reception year he idolised a little boy and was forever talking about him then during year 1 most of the boys in my sons class started playing as a large group (my other twin is another shyer and quieter) this group would play tag, hide and seek then came the play fighting! This soon got out of hand and no matter how many time we told him not to playfight etc he was always in the thick of it! He came home over the space of 2 weeks with 4 first aid slips saying hit in nose/bumped nose etc resulting in a nose bleed. I have never been a not my child parent so again said it's your own fault Do Not join in etc, I also spoke to the teacher and basically said if he is getting hurt surley other are aswell and they need to keep an eye on it. That's when our problems started, the teacher obviously spoke to the other parents and the year group were spoken to and told no playfighting. Well boys being boys always find away around it but the boy who my son idolised in reception has now turned into the leader of the class boys. Everytime they were caught it was blamed on my son, he would get wrong at school and home and again banned from playing. The boys mother shoots daggers at us both and will loudly tell her son not to play as they are too silly together...... fair enough as they are! But this parent is very vocal on the fact it can't be her son and can at times be abit of a shrieking bantee when she talks to him. The worst comment came in reception when she openly told him when her son came out crying one day he does not let other children push him around or he will have her to deal with, it's his own fault if he wants to be a girl about things other children won't respect him!!

A few months ago my son came home and was complaining in his words his parts were hurting, it turned out this boy had purposely been kneeing him in the privates and the more my son cried the more he laughed, on speaking to the teacher and trying not to name him she actually said is it x? He has been in alot of trouble today but it's a shame as he is such a nice boy. My problem is this boy seems to be very sly at what he does and will openly blame other people (not just my son) for things he will make up games then blame someone else when they get told off. a while ago I was talking to another parent who openly said her son would come home crying as this boy would take pencils from him then call him a liar introit of the class and also give him the odd nip, she asked for them to be put on separate tables to stop it etc

Anyway They go to karate together as do alot of their class and the past few weeks I have seen this boy give other children the odd dig in the back or shove them as he goes past them, last night he did everything in his power to get a reaction from my son, it may sound silly but they each have their own space in the line when their instructor starts the lesson and as my son was standing in his space ready, this boy came behind him and very roughly shoved him forward, my son turned and tried to get back in his space but again was pushed away again and told by the instructor to just move and get in line, this happened wherever my son stood and by the end of the lesson I felt I was giving my son bad advice by telling him to just ignore the boys and move as my husband said this gives the impression it's OK to let someone treat you like that as my son says he does this all the time at school when they line up for dinner and always pushes my son to the back, he said he tells the dinner nanny but they never do anything 

I feel like it's escalating and don't know what to do about it as at the minute it's all low level things but I dont want my son to think it's OK to teat people like that or let people push you around the way this boy is

My husband said not to get involved and our son will have to learn to stick up for himself 

Sorry just needed to get it all off my chest

Ano60cez,"Hi there,

I am not sure what to do at the moment regarding my son and another little boy in his class. My son is well behaved and doing well at school and is popular among his peers but he is smaller than average at the moment. He was picked as a role model for a little boy who was very badly behaved at the beginning of term and they have been going with about 4 others to a lunchtime club and the other boy and my son became quite close and the teacher told me the other boys behaviour had improved a lot thanks to my son and the other children at the club. Recently the little boy had been spitting at the teachers and ounched another teacher in the face and my son said she was crying in the class :(.

My son came home last week and said this boy had been pushing him around and kicked him in the private at the lunchtime club so I phoned his teacher Monday morning to say that I didn't want my son going to the lunchtime club for a few weeks till he felt happy to again which she agreed with. Today in PE this other boy has strangled my son for 10 seconds and punhced him in the stomach and pushed him to the floor (apparently the teacher didn't see), but the boy admitted it. The teacher said they will be kept apart in class etc from now on as she is worried it will escalate. I am so angry for my son, he is a kind boy and is worried about being told off if he retaliates but I also don't want him being a pushover. This boy seems to do things behind the teachers' back.

I want to tell my son to stand up for himself and not let this boy push him around again. We live in a reasonably rough area of London and I feel that standing up for yourself as long as you are not being a bully is a necessity of growing up. Surely if he does nothing it will get worse?? Any advice please....Hi there,I am not sure what to do at the moment regarding my son and another little boy in his class.  My son is well behaved and doing well at school and is popular among his peers but he is smaller than average at the moment.  He was picked as a role model for a little boy who was very badly behaved at the beginning of term and they have been going with about 4 others to a lunchtime club and the other boy and my son became quite close and the teacher told me the other boys behaviour had improved a lot thanks to my son and the other children at the club.  Recently the little boy had been spitting at the teachers and ounched another teacher in the face and my son said she was crying in the class :(.My son came home last week and said this boy had been pushing him around and kicked him in the private at the lunchtime club so I phoned his teacher Monday morning to say that I didn't want my son going to the lunchtime club for a few weeks till he felt happy to again which she agreed with.  Today in PE this other boy has strangled my son for 10 seconds and punhced him in the stomach and pushed him to the floor (apparently the teacher didn't see), but the boy admitted it. The teacher said they will be kept apart in class etc from now on as she is worried it will escalate. I am so angry for my son, he is a kind boy and is worried about being told off if he retaliates but I also don't want him being a pushover.  This boy seems to do things behind the teachers' back.I want to tell my son to stand up for himself and not let this boy push him around again.

Flo66snt,"Last Thursday my son, 6yrs, was injured at school, thing is he is special needs, in mainstream and aching to join in games with all his class mates. Basically he wanted to play with two children and they made a game up which involved stamping on my sons feet, no other point to it other than just stamping on his feet and no one else's, told him he was not allowed to tell anyone, which resulted in not finding out till a day later in the evening when they were infected and his sister had pointed them out (he had taken his socks off under his bed covers, is unusual but didn't click at the time!).

Despite trying to keep his toes clean and doing basic first aid etc we ended up at hospital on Sunday to get them seen as they just didn't seem to be getting any better, was told to carry on with what I have already been doing and come back at end of week if no change or sooner if they get worse. He has deep tissue damage, will have a scar and may loose his toe nails. 

As it turns out after speaking with my son, there seem to be lots of games where he gets hurt but he not allowed to &#034;join in&#034; because he says he is not told the rules by these two children nor tell anyone about them. 
I have spoke to the school in past and get told he is a popular child and its just rough play. I know boys will be boys but after speaking with him seems a lot more than that to me. I know my son is no angel but he is very honest and is naive when he told things are a game, he's just happy to be apart of the game. 
My son has an ipra in place which states he needs watching over at all times and it makes me wonder why nothing has been picked up on and why no one saw what happened on Thursday?
I feel frustrated and angry, as I am sure any parent would!

At this time I am keeping my son home from school as I cant trust the school from not keeping him from getting his feet hurt any further via accidents or more stupid &#034;games&#034;.

School was told yesterday morning, my partner went in and showed the pictures off his phone, which we had to email in again and explain what our son had told us. We have been told that they are going to talk to the teachers and those on the yard last Thursday. So far haven't had any feed back on the matter, no email, phone call or even being there to talk to either me or my partner at end of school day when collecting my other child (I know its only been one day, but still they could still let us know if they are investigating it). 

Basically I want to know what the schools procedures for incidents like these? I will be contacting them back over the matter as I don't want it swept under the carpet as such! But would be helpful to know what steps the school has to follow.

The incident was witnessed by the teacher and 3 other boys. 
To me the boy is targeting my son. I had a chat with teacher last time it happened. They said they'll keep an eye though they said it seemed my son 'wasn't bothered'. Today no teacher mentioned today's incident. My son told me what happened during dinner time. 
My husband is a martial arts instructor. Last time the boy hit my son hubby told him he needs to defend himself and report it immediately to a teacher. So my little boy did exactly that today.

Jay26juj,"Hi, I would welcome any advice from parents of children at Senior school. My DS is in Yr 7, he is a bright boy who is doing well and has a good circle of friends.
However, most days he comes home telling me about an incident involving one of a few boys, and I would like some perspective about whether this is just 'normal' behaviour or whether I should be concerned.
Examples would be a boy shoving him on the stairs so he falls over, throwing a pen at him, pinning him against a wall, tellng him to f*** off, taking his water bottle. On their own they seem like small things and DS has kind of accepted it as how things are at school for him. He's also quite a sensitive boy, so I don't know if he just needs to 'toughen up' a bit.
I have spoken to his tutor who has encouraged DS to tell her about any problems, but I think he feels silly reporting each incident because on their own they are quite small things. But together they add up to his school life not being the best.
Sorry this is a bit of a ramble, I'd just really appreciate an outisde perspective on this. Is it normal stuff? Should he just get on with it?

Ste71xaq,"Hi All
It's been awhile since I was on here. I know that you are all great at advice and help others see the bigger picture.

My daughter is currently year 4 (8) and for the last two years has had friendship issues, group of girls who are the best of enemies and the worst of friends. Over the last 4 months they have all started to single her out, leave her with nobody to play with, not let her use their things when they allow others, poking her with whiteboard pens etc......general unkindness that's getting her down. I have witnessed it myself so I know it's not her being sensitive.

My new thought was try and get her into some kind of hobby that she could do on her own and make new friends, and something her older sister didn't do.

Any ideas on regular clubs that's a bit different to dance etc?

Ing44sji,"Hello mums,
I desperately need your advice. I am having this dilema for so long and nobody to discuss it with. 
 Me and my friend have known each other for about 4 years now. We met each other when our children were 1 year old. I absolutely love my friend - we have so much in common, can chat for hours everyfay and she is really amazing person to spend time with. Unfortunetly, our children are not getting on that well..First of all our children have completely different temperaments. My friend's son is much more active then my daughter. Since the beginning they didn't play nicely. He used to hit her, bite her and do many other nasty things on her. But they were very young and was hoping this will change once they are older. But it only gets worse, I need to admit. They are 4 years old now, go to the same nursery group and he is literally bullying my daughter- he still hits her, teases her, says he doesn't want to be her friend. As a result my daughter doesn't want to be friends with him and this makes him even more cruel on her. Occasionally, they play nicely, but that doesn't happen very often or for too long. My friend is also very upset about it. She always discipline him and never ignores his behaviour, but he is still behaving in the same way. I believe that underlying reason for his agressive behaviour is his dad behaviour with him, which is way too strict with such a young boy. Another problem is that he is watching violent cartoons made for older children. I tried to explain that to my friend, but she says that he is not agressive to anyone else but my daughter. 
I really don't know what to do. If I end our friendship, I am worrying that I may be regretting when our children are older. She is really good friend of mine. I don't want to loose my dear friend, but don't want my daughter to be suffering because of that. I am trying not to meet her with children outside of nursery anymore. Next year hopefully they go to different school. However, we help each other with childminding. So sometimes she asks me to look after her boy. If I refuse, I would be in trouble as I don't have many friends and relatives and would have difficulties to find someone to look after my daughter in case of emergency. 
Let me know what are your thoughts. Has anybody been in the same situation as me? Thanks for your attention to my post.Hello mums,I desperately need your advice.

Sus50lkd,"Hi everyone, I am writing to see whether anyone else has been in the same situation as I am in now and how they got out of it? 

My daughter started at pre-school today (in Australia). To set the scene she is going to a private all girls school which is hard to get in to.

There is a Mother who I've known for a few years who I have always felt 'not good enough' around. Unfortunately her daughter and ours are good friends and they also live around the corner therefore I have always made a big effort to hold play dates. I have always been polite. I am a shy, sensitive and relatively quiet person who does not enter into the same kind of behaviour as a bully. Recently, in a group which was formed to help our daughters get to know each other before starting school, she has started not replying to invitations. When arriving at school she says hello to my daughter and husband but not to me. At orientation day yesterday she asked the girls from our group to go for a coffee (formed before school) but not me. Today I texted everyone to see whether they wanted to have coffee today - at school we formed a plan but the mother I think is being a bully said she couldn't make it but when I arrived at the cafe she was there.

My husband thinks she is terrible as he witnessed her behaviour this morning first hand and tells me to just stay away from her and never have play dates with her again. But, once my Father said to me that bullies go for people who appear to be weak and I therefore I want to show that I am strong and not phased by her behaviour. My husband also said that her daughter will probably end up like her Mother and this could hurt our daughter who is kind, out going and sensitive.

It is very strange as this Mother always talks about her sister being bullied at school and how terrible it was for her.

Today I started analysing myself - Did I say or do something to upset her to cause her to be like this towards me. I live in a very nice house - although it is worth a lot less than hers and I wonder if she is a social climber? I am blond and skinny and try to dress nicely. 

I was in tears yesterday and it has consumed my thoughts thinking about this today. My daughter is going to be at this school for another 14 years.

Please could someone explain this unpleasant behaviour and tell me how to overcome someone like this. I am happy just to find other friends but why should I have to forgo the friendships of the other lovely girls in the group who don't have a clue what's going on.

Thank you in advance.

Lucy C(876),"I wonder if any one can help me. I have 4 children. Aged 12, 9,6 &amp; 4.

My oldest 2 have autism along with Other medical conditions. Most children who live near us bully them and are nasty as they are different and immature for their age. We had to take them out of school due to bullying and have home educated them for several years now.

We have known are neighbours opposite for 10 year. They have 2 children aged 8 1/2 and 11.

My children have been really good friends with their children and get on with them really well.

Lately things have changed one minute they will want to play with my children and will want to come in to play. And we always welcome them in and they stay for tea etc. The next day they will be plain rude and will not want any thing to do with my children. Instead playing with and going in to another child's house. A child who they no bully's my children ( he has called my children names hit them, thrown rocks at my daughters head and swears non stop.) 

This boy who bully's my children is 11 and his parents are just as horrible, they swear at my children and are rude they also allow him to play games like grand theft auto and call of duty. When out neighbours boy goes in they allow him to play these games as well he is only 8 1/2. 

Some times they will ignore them and want nothing to do with my children for a day some times it's up to a week or two. But as soon as they have no one to play with or get bored they expect to be able to come back and play with my children and come in our house like nothing has happened.

I feel like they are using my children and don't know what to do. Each time they are rude and want nothing to do with my children, my children are deviststed and very upset.

These are the only friends my children have.

What would you do would you allow them to play with your children and come it to your home again knowing they are just going to upset your children again.

Any advice much appreciated

Mar53nft,"Hi, I am the end of my tether with my sons bullying. He has been bullied for over 2 years now by the same 2 boys. He is now 11yrs old and has Aspergers Syndrome. It got so bad that we had to move him to a new school. His previous head teacher done absolutely nothing, it was all just typical boy behaviour (he was beaten everyday, bruised, bloodied and almost had his windpipe crushed, all done inside the class during school hours). I was told he was perfectly safe in the class but he could be let out 5 minutes before the bell to give him a head start to get home before the bullies got to him. He is thriving now at new school but these 2 boys have made it a game to send my son and my 15 yr old daughter messages on xbox, or instagram chats saying they are gonna kill him, he is a &#034;carpet muncher&#034; &#034;gay boy&#034; etc. The police have said I have to ignore it.

Abi18gkq,"For a few weeks now, my son who usually loves his pre-school has cried uncontrollably on a Monday morning when I drop him off - this is unusual, as after taking a few weeks to settle in, he always gives me a happy kiss and cuddle and wave bye bye with smiles when I leave him.

However, it turns out there is one other boy who is only at school with my son on a Monday morning who &#034;pushed him on a chair one time&#034;. Now, everytime my DS sees this boy when we arrive at school he immediately starts crying. The teachers have been great, and call me at work to tell me that his tears stopped within a few minutes of me leaving.

Today was the first day back after the Christmas holidays, he was skipping along and excited to be going back to school. Telling me he'd give me a lovely cuddle and kiss before I went to work. We had spoken about this boy last night and this morning, so he knew that he would be there today. But when we got there, the little boy was there with his father. My son and this boys pegs are next to each other, so as my DS was already crying because he'd seen the &#034;mean boy&#034; i sat down with him on a nearby chair to get his coat etc. off. The other boy came up to his peg, pushed my son and hit him in the face (not nearly hard enough to leave a mark, but enough to scare my son and make him cry harder). The boy's father saw this, and took his son away, saying it's not nice and he shouldn't do that to other people, to say sorry to my DS, but this never happened, it wasn't forced.

The teachers there didn't see it, and when DS's primary carer came over mentioning a long break, assuming he was sad to be at school, I mentioned an altercation with this boy. They know that DS isn't happy with the boy and doesn't like to be near him. In the past they have said that they will keep a close eye on it, and make sure that when they're in the same space that there is always an adult present. I will be speaking to them this afternoon when I collect DS to chat about what we can do, but I just wondered if anyone else has any advice?

I've told DS that when he is at school his teachers are there to look after him like Mummy does, so if someone is mean or pushes him, he needs to tell them and they will call me and we will discuss it. I've told him to try and stay away from this boy and play only with his friends. DS is very sensitive and needs to learn to stand up for himself, but I absolutely do not want to teach him that hitting back for example is the way to do it...

To be honest, I'm at a bit of a loss! It upset me this morning when this boy hit and pushed DS, I was in shock and couldn't quite believe that it had happened!!For a few weeks now, my son who usually loves his pre-school has cried uncontrollably on a Monday morning when I drop him off - this is unusual, as after taking a few weeks to settle in, he always gives me a happy kiss and cuddle and wave bye bye with smiles when I leave him.However, it turns out there is one other boy who is only at school with my son on a Monday morning who ""pushed him on a chair one time"".  Now, everytime my DS sees this boy when we arrive at school he immediately starts crying.  The teachers have been great, and call me at work to tell me that his tears stopped within a few minutes of me leaving.Today was the first day back after the Christmas holidays, he was skipping along and excited to be going back to school.  Telling me he'd give me a lovely cuddle and kiss before I went to work.  We had spoken about this boy last night and this morning, so he knew that he would be there today.  But when we got there, the little boy was there with his father.  My son and this boys pegs are next to each other, so as my DS was already crying because he'd seen the ""mean boy"" i sat down with him on a nearby chair to get his coat etc. off.  The other boy came up to his peg, pushed my son and hit him in the face (not nearly hard enough to leave a mark, but enough to scare my son and make him cry harder).  The boy's father saw this, and took his son away, saying it's not nice and he shouldn't do that to other people, to say sorry to my DS, but this never happened, it wasn't forced.The teachers there didn't see it, and when DS's primary carer came over mentioning a long break, assuming he was sad to be at school, I mentioned an altercation with this boy.  They know that DS isn't happy with the boy and doesn't like to be near him.  In the past they have said that they will keep a close eye on it, and make sure that when they're in the same space that there is always an adult present.  I will be speaking to them this afternoon when I collect DS to chat about what we can do, but I just wondered if anyone else has any advice?I've told DS that when he is at school his teachers are there to look after him like Mummy does, so if someone is mean or pushes him, he needs to tell them and they will call me and we will discuss it.  I've told him to try and stay away from this boy and play only with his friends.  DS is very sensitive and needs to learn to stand up for himself, but I absolutely do not want to teach him that hitting back for example is the way to do it...To be honest, I'm at a bit of a loss!  It upset me this morning when this boy hit and pushed DS, I was in shock and couldn't quite believe that it had happened!!",1,"1,004", 04-01-2016 at 11.36AM

Kar00rdl,My son was a happy chap in primary 1 and 2 and was really popular. Then he started to be bullied by one boy. He moved class this year and it has increased with comments made all the time from various people. He has tried so hard. We have spoken often to the school but to be honest they don't seem to have put anything in place to support him. We told them that we understand that its hard to stop kids saying derogatory comments. However we made it clear that its our son that needs support. He has been saying for months he cant cope. In the last 2 weeks he has become really depressed. For months he hasn't been able to eat. He wakes up through the night sobbing or cries himself to sleep. He now sleeps in with me. He wants hugs all the time and is nothing like the boy he used to be. Last week after a particularly painful chat he told me that he wants to kill himself. I manage to stay calm and tell him I understood and I was proud he could tell me that. We get the feeling that the school believe we are making a big deal about nothing. That he should toughen up as he will have more when he gets to high school. What fo we do when he needs them to support him and they are treating him as having to man-up?My son was a happy chap in primary 1 and 2 and was really popular.

Ire26msk,"Hello everybody

I'm here to recount...really because I've nobody to talk to about this who isn't prejudiced in some way. My son has been bullied every day bar perhaps four or five days since starting secondary school this September.

It started on the school bus and seeped into the school and now my son has been threatened by another pupil, told he is going to kill him and all his family.

We, the parents, have been in touch with the school on what feels like a daily basis. Emails, phonecalls, meetings...complaints to local council etc. The teachers have been attentive in the sense that they have given us the time we need to discuss this...but action has been tepid. The school adopt a 'no blame' approach and apart from a quiet word or two with the bullies as far as I am aware nothing else has happened. They keep saying they haven't witnessed anything...it feels like they are implying that my son is making it up.

My son reported being threatened to the school but because there were no witnesses the school is unwilling to take any action and refuses to take sides. The pupil who made the threat denies it. I trust my son...why would he make that up? 

My boy is now depressed, anxious and frightened...and hates school. He feels isolated, an unwanted member of the community. The advice he is given at school centres around him making changes to the way he reacts to the bullies but it's a big ask for an 11 year old who has been systematically bullied daily for two months +.

We want to move him out of the school but his next nearest school is in special measures!

Zau141z,"Hi,

My son in the past few weeks has changed. He says no one plays with him at school, no one listens to him when he speaks and the kids all laugh at him at play/lunchtime.

He is 5 and this is very upsetting for me. He said to me the other day if I can do anything :o(

I said I would go to the school which he was ok with. This morning before school he asked me not to say anything to the school so I said to him I have to make sure he is happy at school and that no one is horrible to him (which he says happens sometimes) in order for me to do this I have to speak to them so he said ok.

I have an appointment with his teacher tomorrow and I want to make sure I ask the right questions. I will put everything to the school and ask them what they can do. Does anyone know what else I should make sure I ask/cover?

Antonia (20),"Do you think it's right for kids to fight back to physical bullying at any age? Very varied opinions on the subject. I've been bullied my entire life so my views are a bit skewed and would love outside perspective.

Very small incident at nursery today where my 3 yr old said a boy (named him) hit her in the face on purpose for wanting a toy he had. She told a teacher and said he was told off. I was glad she did this and told her how proud I was and that you always tell someone no matter what.

She also however told me she shoved him back after he hit her. Every fibre of me wanted to say &#034;good girl!&#034;, I didn't though I just froze because I didn't want to advocate violence obviously. But to be honest I don't want her being shoved around either? 

What would you say? Be the bigger person and walk away or let then give as good as they get? Not like she punched him. I've seen something similar with her in soft play where a boy twice her size hit her in the head on purpose and she smacked him back and said &#034;you aren't allowed to touch me like that&#034;. I've never told her to do it.... I also haven't told her off. And I did say &#034;Noone is ever allowed to hit you&#034; and to always always tell a grown up.

anna i(28),"My 5 year old now in year 1, has friends at school and enjoys school. The only thing I'm concerned about is he has come home with muddy coat twice in one week saying a boy pushed him in mud. One time the teacher wrote note in book about him being pushed over &amp; said it was being dealt with. It's not frequent but does happen &amp; today was his school disco &amp; teacher said he fell over &amp; cried. When I asked if he had good time he says no, because a boy hit him. I don't think it's bullying, but how do I advise him to avoid this boy &amp; others who seem to find him an easy target... He's got speech delay from grommets, and very rough &amp; tumble himself but he's so caring I don't think he's triggering anything. I don't think it's bullying as he's still happy at school &amp; no other withdrawn symptoms. But I want to know tips I can give him in these situations someone pushes/hits him, so any tips please?! Thank you!My 5 year old now in year 1, has friends at school and enjoys school. The only thing I'm concerned about is he has come home with muddy coat twice in one week saying a boy pushed him in mud. One time the teacher wrote note in book about him being pushed over & said it was being dealt with. It's not frequent but does happen & today was his school disco & teacher said he fell over & cried. When I asked if he had good time he says no, because a boy hit him. I don't think it's bullying, but how do I advise him to avoid this boy & others who seem to find him an easy target...

Gemma D(97),"My son is 7 years old and has always been very calm, he has two younger sisters so it takes loads and loads to wind him up and see if he will retaliate which he rarely ever does. My son also likes building and spends a lot of time building and constructing things, anyway he built something the other week and a boy came and pushed it on purpose, it didnt fall so he pushed again, my son pushed it back up.and unfortunately it hit the boy. 

Now they both went to headteacher and got into trouble. The problem is everyday this boy is pushing my son around, ive tried telling him to hit back and he wont as he is worried he will get into trouble which to me doesnt seem fair. 

This boy in question does this to other kids too, has been removed from sitting with the rest of the class and been excluded from out of school groups.

Nicolle B(11),"Hello,

I'm not sure if this is the right place to write this as it's not bullying as such but juts looking for some advice. My son (nearly 3) was at the local play centre yesterday playing with his friend when another little boy grabbed him by the throat and hit him around the face for no reason what so ever.

My son has scratch marks on his neck and his face was bright red obviously he was crying and upset, I told the other boy off went to his mum etc and the situation was dealt with.

However my son still Keeps mentioning it and becomes upset when talking about it, I'm not sure how to handle this what I should say to him to make him feel better 😔

Lyn46bqq,"Hi I'm new to the site and looking for some advice.

My 10 year old daughter over the last month has become friends with a group of girls at school who have been friends for a while. Since starting school she has been friendly with these girls but recently become more friendly. However the ringleader is a strong character and has basically taken a dislike to my daughter and made all the other girls stop playing with my daughter. Only 1 of the girls will still play with her. My daughter is now extremely upset going to school. I have explained that she does have other friends to play with as she is a popular and happy child but feel so upset for her right now as this ringleader is leaving her out. This has happened to another girl before my daughter with the same ringleader being the problem. 

My question is should I leave the situation for a week and see if things blow over as feel she needs to stand up to a bully herself or should I speak with the school?

Mel30xib,"Hi all. Just wanted to know if anyone has any thoughts about how to deal with an awful situation my family have found themselves in. My daughter (13) has a school friend (also 13), who one minute she is great friends with, and the next this other child is making up stories and spreading lies about my daughter, having a go at her at school, and encouraging others to do the same. My daughter is heartbroken, forgives her, and then has to go through it all over again a couple of weeks later. I know all of this is true because I read all my daughters social media private messages (this was the rule for allowing her to have an account). After the umpteenth time of this happening last week, I contacted the other girls mother. We had a very reasonable conversation - she was apologetic and mortified by her daughters behaviour. She promised that she would have a stern word with the daughter, contact the school counsellor (who already provide support owing the family's problems with drugs and alcohol), and remove her daughters access to social media. 5 days later and she hasn't been in touch with school (I contacted them myself on Friday), and her daughter is still posting to Facebook. My daughter had told some friends last week that me and the other mother has had a chat and everything was sorted. This other girl is now accusing my daughter of lying about this, and accusing me and my husband of also lying, saying we never spoke to her mum. I also have it on extremely good authority that the Mum has also denied to other students (go figure how that situation came up!), that we ever spoke. Clearly, this is going around school now that my daughter is a liar and making stuff up about the other girls parents. It's become a nightmare.

Bullying is devastating for children, it's crippling and can lead to depression and suicide . I should know - I've been there as a young child myself. However, it CAN be stopped and dealt with using these 3 EASY STEPS! 

 

Hopefully by posting this video I've just made here, it can help children who are going through a rough time with bullying, and can also be used as helpful information for parents.

All the best,

Chr20bom,"Hi everyone.

My son is in reception and is the youngest boy in the class. He attended the nursery last year doing mornings every day. He was always the first one in and really sociable and smart. We had barely any problems.

Within 2 weeks of starting school my DS was regularly mentioning how another boy was being physically hurtful to other children. (Punching smacking biting )

One day my son came home with dried blood on his face, when asked he said that the boy had punched him in the face and he had a nose bleed. I asked if he had told anyone and he said he'd told the teacher who wiped it with a tissue and told him to go back and play. I didn't receive a medical slip nor did anyone talk to me about it. 

My son has gotten progressively more difficult to get out of the house in the mornings, he has even said on occasions that he doesn't want to go, which is unlike him. 

At parents evening we brought it up and were assured that the boy was on a behavioural plan of some sort, and that he would be closely watched and kept apart from our son. 

The next day my son came home with holes in his trousers. The same boy had been cutting his trousers so he thought he'd copy (I know kids do that but my issue here is that they had assured me they would be kept apart and the boy would be watched, yet they were left together unwatched for long enough to hack their trousers up, in the sharp scissor section! )

Another day he came home with a scratch on his face from said boy. He also tells me that this boy follows him round constantly and doesn't leave him alone. 

Friday just gone the teacher came to speak to me as apparently my son pushed a boy and the boy retaliated by biting him, I wasn't told the boys name and told there was a red mark and my son was not phased by it. At home I found out it was the same boy, that my son had been crying as it really hurt, and the mark was so vivid that you could see individual teeth on it! (The bite was through a sweater btw) Also the reason he pushed him was that he was following him again (an attempt at sticking up for himself I'd assume)

At home my son is becoming violent and lashing out at me and his sister. He's also moody, snappy and angry, and will not listen to me if I ask him to do a simple task. It's becoming a nightmare and a battle to get him ready in the mornings. 

I'm booking a meeting with the head tomorrow but honestly I have no idea what to say, where I'm able to go from here, or what I can or should expect from them. They are an Ofsted outstanding rated school, in a reasonably good area, so I didn't think we'd encounter anything like this. Also I don't know if this matters but he has two teachers who do half the week each, rather than one teacher all week.

Reb36jzh,"Hiya, this is not of a complicated situation but one that had been causing me a lot of worry and upset. So I hope you all don't think it's as petty as I sometimes feel it is. 

Basically friends of mine and my partner have a daughter 6 months younger than ours, who is nearly 3. It was really nice at first coz the girls would play and have fun together. But as they have got older it has transpired that my friends daughter is a lot more advanced than mine and she started to use this to wind her up. At first I would tell my daughter off for being whingey as this is how it seemed at first but I started noticing things that she was doing to wind my daughter up (such as waving something she's not allowed in her face till she starts moaning and then innocently walking off once my daughter is moaning knowing she will get in trouble) this is just an example. My partner has noticed things too. And things as serious as being pinned down or locked in a play house till she cries. She is such a clever toddler that she can be very sly and make it look like my daughter is the one causing trouble. I have also noticed her doing the same to other kids and their parents also telling their own kids off!! 

We distanced ourselves slightly but it's hard without being bluntly horrible because they are obsessed with the girls being best friends! The girls have now started preschool together and me and daddy are concerned things would happen at school and our daughter would get blame. I had a word with the teacher but not sure they believed me and haven't said anything about it since. I changed my daughters days so she was doing different days and my friend changed her daughters days too so they would go to school together again! 

She is very dominating over my daughter and I'm worried that she will get her in trouble not to mention how unhappy she is around her. I've got to the point where I'm not fussed about the friendship but don't wanna be horrible. I am actually thinking of changing school or moving now. Not sure what to do tho. This is long story short so missing out loads but long enough so hopefully gives you an idea of my problem. I appreciate any advice at all.

My DD 12 started high school last September and its been an up and down ride for her, not the best start really.

She became very quiet and lost a lot of confidence, however I thought that was to be expected to some degree because of the change in environment etc we tried to work on this at home. 

In the early days I had to go into school to as people were taking her stationary and breaking it or once they took parts of her lunch.

She rarely does anything wrong behaviour wise but when she's told off she is so sad. 
For example: if you are just saying &#034;don't snatch it's rude&#034;.

School have said she is her usual self, but then the new teachers don't really know the way she use to be. 
I feel awful, like I'm missing something. 
She says she just gets sad sometimes and when she loses confidence it's because she knows she will be rubbish at whatever activity she's doing. 
she was like this when she was bullied 2 years ago, however that all got dealt with and she was happy again, she's just never been the same confidence wise.
She's not being bullied again so all I know is that it's not history repeating itself. 
I really don't know what to do??? 

Any advice welcome.

Aar80yhn,"***MUMS AND DADS OF JUNIOR SCHOOL KIDS READ THIS***

Okay fellow mums and dads Im gonna need you to dig deep and help me out here.

My son Leo (8yrs) has been getting bullied at school for several months (yes months) by a little bully we will call &#034;Carl&#034;. 

It started last school year and after a couple of times of him telling the dinner ladies (or lunch time supervisors for those PC people) and then a couple of times of him telling his form teacher nothing stopped. 

His mum went into the school (and shes a bit of a hot head) words were exchanged with the teacher and her but nothing changed, apart from Leo telling me about everything instead of his mum...so I went into the school. 

I went through their anti-bullying policy and ripped it to pieces making a note of all the things that they had failed to adhere to as well as ticking off the things that we were told they'd do and what they actually have done. 

I went in, spoke to the deputy headteacher (who is in charge of the anti-bullying dept.) and she basically said they can SOMETIMES be as bad as each other. 

Now...I get that my son isn't a golden child all of the time but I know he is a good kid and enjoys going to school, reading, maths etc. I know for a fact that Leo wouldn't have instigated the MAJORITY of the happenings but she continued on to say she would keep a closer eye on it, theres nothing to worry about yadda yadda yadda. 

She then spoke to Leo and told him to stay away, dont talk to him, tell a teacher etc. the usual stuff which is all well and good but he was coming home and he was emotionally charged, taking things out on his brother and sister at his mums house. 

He also comes home visibly upset, has bruises (not uncomon for kids) but he's being held down, kicked in the back (theres a mark on his back today apparently his mum said - she told me over the phone). 

This has all started again, he's now scared to go to school, he's done what they said, and despite all of this he is getting told off at school because &#034;Carl&#034; is getting up, hitting him and then running to teachers and telling them Leo has hit them. 

So not only is he getting bullied but hes getting punished for it too!!!

I'm at the point now where I'm going to have to do something serious because I've had enough. 

Fair enough if that little bully wants to end up like his dad in prison but I dont want my son to be scared to go to school everyday like he is at the moment. 

I'm going into school tomorrow so any advice/help would be appreciated. I don't want him to have to move schools again it's not fair on him and he's the victim here.

Dav32yia,"Hi

I've looked online but cannot find any resources on how to deal with a particular bullying situation.

My child starts high school this September. She is small for her age but is quite confident with her close friends.

I worry that if someone approaches her and snatches things from her (such as bag, coat, pencil case etc...) she won't know how to deal with it. A potential scenario is were another girl or boy grabs something and then taunts her with it. Despite my child asking for it back.

Does anyone know how to deal with this kind of scenario? If it's in a class she could tell a teacher, if it's outside of school on way home what could she do?

Les70pzg,"She doesn't go to school in our area as I didn't want to change it after we moved so she doesn't see these girls at school. (She's 10 btw).
She used to go out and play out the back as there's a park looking out of our windows at the back but put a stop to it when she was getting bullied and finally when she came home with a burst lip after being pushed to the floor and kicked in the face!
She's not allowed to play out there anymore and hasn't done for a good year or so. We take her out and she goes to play with friends in other areas so she isn't stuck indoors all day.
The last couple of months every weekend I've had to tell these other girls from the same street to stop picking on her at her bedroom window (we live in a ground floor flat). They are standing making threats pulling faces and generally intimidating her. It's bad enough she can't go out to play but ends up sitting in her room with her curtains closed so they can't harass her.
Might sound very trivial but it's actually really getting on top of us. It's so unfair on her.
I've just warned them literally 10 minutes ago to leave her alone again and the next time they do it I'm reporting it to the police. Might sound harsh but it's not right she can't even sit in her room without being picked on!

We take her out and she goes to play with friends in other areas so she isn't stuck indoors all day.The last couple of months every weekend I've had to tell these other girls from the same street to stop picking on her at her bedroom window (we live in a ground floor flat). They are standing making threats pulling faces and generally intimidating her. It's bad enough she can't go out to play but ends up sitting in her room with her curtains closed so they can't harass her.Might sound very trivial but it's actually really getting on top of us. It's so unfair on her.I've just warned them literally 10 minutes ago to leave her alone again and the next time they do it I'm reporting it to the police. Might sound harsh but it's not right she can't even sit in her room without being picked on!Anyone got any advice? Xxx",28,"4,252", 07-02-2015 at 3.34PM

karen f(329),"Hi all

I have an 11 year old son, is always being mean to his 9 year old sister. today at my mums house she was just sitting oppersite him and was moving her legs and he told her not to move them, its like his the adult, and wants her to look at him when hes speaking wants her to say sorry to him when shes done nothing wrong. I say to him shes done nothing wrong apart from move her legs. he wont let up untill he gets an apology from her, we had to go home from my mums cos he would stop having a go. when shes drinking in the car he says dont drink you make me feel like i want the loo.
he says dont spit at me when shes having a drink in car. 
do you think maybe he has some sort of autistic sysdrome? we had him checked out for autisum a few years back, they said he had some traits of it, but not enough, to say he is. he says she irritates him but she doesnt do any thing to him, she wont tell him off, she just says sorry but she doesnt need to, but is trying to keep the piece. hes seen a private councillor twice. we stop him using the laptop put him in his room, say its not nice to speak to her like this and would you like it, and he says no. 
but he still does it. he doesnt do any thing much apart from go on the laptop and watch tv and dont have any friends, apart from one girl who used to come round here. she doesnt any more. i'm wondering if hes jelous of his sister. i asked him if he was and he said no. hes not having a go at her 24 7, but a lot of the time he is.
has any one got any suggestions.

We have moved a bit with husbands work but have now settled (end of 2012) near his family.

We had bullying towards my DSlast year &amp; it ended up him being strangled, the school tried to cover it up but failed &amp; we ended up winning our case with the Secretary of State for the governors not following the complaints procedure. 

Said boy was enentually put in a specialist school. 

There are 2 other boys who have started being violent to DS &amp; also now having problems with 2 boys &amp; my 2 DS's. 

Behaviour not improved even after our complaint. 

We've had 7 incidents in the past 2 months, 2 of them being violent &amp; 1 towards my DD in reception!! 

A complaint clearly won't change things. If we change schools we can no longer walk to school &amp; nor the family thus meaning I would have to change my job to do school hours. Plus it would be our 4th school.

sar42goy,"Hi guys. 
Well are children have moved to a new school due to it being closer now. 
Camron 10 Thomas 8 tejay 8 rubie they have all been bulied every day since they started i thought id let it go the first week as unfortunately it is normally the new kids that get it iv always told them tell the teacher or nearest adult which they have been doing but nothing got done i spoke to thomas's teacher as he is being really badly hurt she said there are alot of children there that have behaviour issues and thomas dose not know which kids to stay away from so ends up in altercations. I feel that is a very bad excuse surly if these children were that uncontrollable then they should be in a special school that is more able to help them. 
The final straw was thomas coming out of school saying that these boys kicked him down onto the floor then took it in turns to jump on him and 1 boy stamped on his head i marched straight back in to school and spoke to their behaviour teacher he said he will deal with it. And then today exactly the same thing happened again but because these boy's have issues they dont get spoken to or anything.
Now i dont want to be a nag i know kids scrap but i cant not sit buy and let this happen to my children. Camron keeps getting stabbed in the arm with sharp pencils and getting punched and kicked rubie got kicked in the face by an older boy and tejay keeps getting punched.
I want to approach the mums and say something do you think this is wise? I will speak to the school and if needs be ring the police stamping on someones head is so dangerous. The school don't seem that interested.

Katie B(77),"My daughter is in year 6 and there are only a couple of other girls in her year. One is really nice but the other are being really nasty to her and have been for a couple of months. Everyday my daughter tells me they laugh at her, call her names ,hid her stuff and say really nasty stuff. Today she was laughed at in front all the boys as she has not yet started to develop boobs. Another child told her she is so well behaved now she will probably be a slut when she is older. Many times when she talks to them she is told to go away and mind her own business. I have been into school about it a couple of times and nothing has changed. I was told that my daughter needs to tell them at the time or they can't do anything. The problem is they are really nasty to her if they find out she has told so she doesn't want to tell. Also school have pointed out that she still plays with these children. However, she plays with them as there is no one else to play with and also she is far too loyal to her 'friends'. I have told her that she needs to stop playing with these children as playing with them is effectively giving them the message that their bad behaviour is ok. However, she says sometimes they are really nice so those times she wanta to play with them.

My DS is 9 nearly 10 and currently in Year 4. He told me and his dad that a boy in his class pushed him the ground during lunch time, said &#034;I'm going to rape you&#034; then pinned him down on the floor and rubbed his privates (through clothes) on my DS's bum. Our DS was very upset by this because the boy is a lot bigger and stronger than him and he couldn't fight him off. Obviously we are very upset and angry about this and complained to the school. The child was spoken to and kept in the following day's lunch time as punishment. The head said the boy denied it but they would monitor his behaviour. Trouble is this boy is allowed to play violent video games such as GTA. He regularly swears, uses racist language and says other sexually inappropriate things to other children in the class. The head asked if my DS had misheard him! We are concerned that the aren't taking this seriously enough. It's not so much the words he said but the action itself! I was saddened and angry to hear that this boy has done the same thing to another boy in the class since the incident with my DS so will be speaking to the head tomorrow.

Tra49lfs,"My 6 year old daughter has been having a rough time at school.

For the last year she has been a victim of bullying. A small group of three boys and one girl have been continuously picking on her including:
 
 Excluding her from activities
 Name calling
 Swearing at her
 Pinching
 Punching
 Kicking
 Ruining her personal possessions
 


I have spoken to her teacher on many occasions but all she ever does is act like it's no big deal and tries to brush it under the carpet, I have spoken to the deputy head who said and i quote &#034;oh no, that doesn't sound like them.&#034; She then went almost as far as to accuse my daughter of lying about it all! I have been chasing the head teacher for months but all i ever get is, &#034;I'm sorry, but he's too busy.&#034; I understand that he is busy, but shouldn't he make time to handle a situation like this?! Two weeks ago I handed him a formal letter of complaint, I am yet to receive a response. 

Today my daughter didn't want to go to school, when i asked her why she said she was scared they would hurt her again. (I even wrote that in the late book we have to fill in.) It seems she was right to worry. Whilst lining up to go back into class after play time, two of the boys kicked her relentlessly in the bum and lower back until a teacher saw what was happening and intervened. I received a brief phone call from the deputy head 5 minutes before school finished to inform me what had happened. She said that the two boys had been excluded/suspended and parents spoken to. (Imagine my surprise when i arrived to pick up my daughter and saw that the children in question were still in school.)

My question is what do i do now? It seems the school aren't exactly interested. Could anybody that has been in my situation before please give me some advice. I have no idea what to do.

Sarah W(1971),"Hi, hope some mums out there can advise me. My son is 6 and in year 1. Last term he told me that the &#034;bad boy gang&#034; at school were being horrible to him and others, playing rough and teasing. When I heard there was pushing and shoving involved I reported it to the teacher who was very understanding and had a chat with these boys without naming my son - they were doing it to others there too.

Today it was their growing project day. My son and worked hard on his growing diary about his strawberry plant. When I came into the school for the display for parents I couldn't understand why he was trying to hide his diary which he worked hard on. He then started to read it to some parents he knew but was trying to cover some pages.

Turns put one of the band boy gang, earlier in the day, had asked to look at the diary and proceeded to draw all over it with black felt tip pen. He didn't destroy the work thankfully but he did write over so!e blank pages with silly drawings. Some of the others in this group then laughed at it in front of my son and me! I had some words directly with that child (who hadn't even done a growing diary themselves), gently reminding that we do not laugh at people's hard work and I was disappointed when I saw that.

I was very upset about the drawing and told the teacher who agreed she would speak to the boy and his mum after school. However what worries me more is that my child initially did not want to say anything to me or the teacher as he felt embarrassed. My worry is that he is being bullied and internalising the issue, thinking it is something to do with him and who he is. He doesn't seem to understand that it is the other boy in the wrong and it is not his fault that this happened.

Any advice? I was hoping there may be some TV program about bullying to show him so he understands to tell someone and that it is not his fault he was bullied. I remember going through similar at school I very much thought it was because of me, not them,. Don't want him to go through the same. My heart breaks for him. :-(

I had some words directly with that child (who hadn't even done a growing diary themselves), gently reminding that we do not laugh at people's hard work and I was disappointed when I saw that.I was very upset about the drawing and told the teacher who agreed she would speak to the boy and his mum after school.  However what worries me more is that my child initially did not want to say anything to me or the teacher as he felt embarrassed. My worry is that he is being bullied and internalising the issue, thinking it is something to do with him and who he is.  He doesn't seem to understand that it is the other boy in the wrong and it is not his fault that this happened.Any advice? I was hoping there may be some TV program about bullying to show him so he understands to tell someone and that it is not his fault he was bullied.  I remember going through similar at school I very much thought it was because of me, not them,. Don't want him to go through the same. My heart breaks for him. Sorry for long post, thanks for reading, hope someone can advise x",6,893, 05-06-2015 at 4.23PM  
Mar81tyt,My son is having trouble with the boy he plays with the most outside of school. I am not sure how to put it into words but am at my wits end. My son I'll call him W and his friend that I'll call T play out together along with some others. T has been fighting my W and hurting him. Then he will play bad guys but the only 'bad guy' is W. This is bullying! But because I am not there I can't stop it. I can't stop him playing out all summer because that is punishing W which isn't fair. I have told him to refuse to play bad guys and to come home if he starts frighting. He says he trys to but T won't let him leave. I know boys tell tales and there is two sides to every story but he is coming home hurt so I think it must be mostly true. What do I do? They also go school together but he doesn't do this there.My son is having trouble with the boy he plays with the most outside of school. I am not sure how to put it into words but am at my wits end.

Ang24oil,"Hi
My son is almost 3 and attends playgroup twice a week (without me).
For a while he's been talking about the 'bad boy' who pushes/hits him etc. I spoke to playgroup leader and she said it's not only my son who is mistreated by this same boy and that he is dealt with appropriately blah blah blah. I also spoke to the boy's mum because I didn't want her to think I was going behind her back. She was nice about it but didn't seem to have any answers (or apologise). 

The problem hasn't gone away- today my son said he was scared of the other boy and that he hid from him.

Only 4 weeks left of playgroup before end of term (starts nursery after summer hols). Don't want to withdraw my son from the group but don't want to put him through trauma every week either. 

My son is outgoing but is also sensitive.
He's attended this group since last September and is otherwise settled.

Any suggestions? Anyone experienced this?

A few months ago i went to my daughters parents evening. Its her first year at school and she is 5. The teacher told us she is above average academically however she is really mean to other child and often makes them cry. Since then both me and her father (we are not together) have been very strict with her and take no messing. She doesn't get what she wants all the time and is disciplined when naughty. However i went to pick her up today from school and the teacher asked me to stay back, she told me the issue has not improved and has actually got worse!!! She has been really mean to a new girl that has come to the school, telling other children to push her and run away from her. And she had made a girl cry today. I dont know what else to do, nothing seems to work at all. 

She also has a very bad attitude and is always back chatting. Her dad also informs me that when she is at his she is very rude and often ignores is sisters and father when spoken to. She is also like this at home with me and my husband. She acts like a teenager half the time and doesn't take it well when shes told no. Im so embarrassed as this is not the way i am raising her.

Amy K(203),"There's such a sad story around where I am about a poor 15 year old boy who hung himself in a local park because he was being bullied. He initially survived but has died today.

This makes me so sad and angry. I was a victim of bullying, and shared a room with my bullies as I was at boarding school. I was only 12, my school didn't believe me, and I suffered for several months before anything was done.

What should be done to help bullied kids in schools? It so hard as teachers have so much to do already, but I think all schools Ned better pastoral care. Almost like American schools with guidance counsellors (I know some schools do but it should be mandatory in my eyes).

Mel77hhx,"Hello all

I just had to come and post this thread for as much my own sanity as for getting advice so if you read and can offer any words of advice its all much appreciated!

Yesterday I had to go and collect my son from school as he had been thrown to the floor in the playground by the class bully (that he was a bully was unbeknown to me before this) and landed straight on his face, suffering from an extremely swollen nose and eye. The teacher assured me when I collected him that this would be dealt with by not allowing the bullying child out to play for two days and he had to write a letter of apology to my son. I took my son to see a doctor who has advised that we need to wait until the swelling has reduced before its clear what damage has been done to his nose. My OH called the school to discuss and discovered from the teacher that the child who attacked my son has also been involved in 4 other incidents previously where he has hurt and bullied children in his class. The child's mother has been also been called in to the school to discuss today as she feels that her son, the bully, is being unfairly untreated!! ( I'm outraged at this!!!!!)

I am sat here swinging between feelings of rage and wanting to go and confront the mother to wanting to sit here and cry at the thought of my son being hurt so badly. He has gone into school fairly happily today which makes me so thankful that he hasn't been too traumatised emotionally by it yet at the same time Im worried sick about him. Worried that this child will see his face and might feel pride or satisfaction at what he has done, that he thinks he can do it again and that my son will suffer further injury.....

I know the bully has been kept back a year by the school so is, essentially, a year older than the other children in the class and I now want to request that the child is moved back to the higher class in light of this and the fact he has been bullying children before. Im not sure what sway I hold as a parent of a child at the school but Im sure going to push!

I've also advised the school that I have told my child that if he is hit or pushed or made to feel threatened by this child again that he can defend himself by any way he needs to, either by punching, kicking or pushing him away. The school are not happy with this and do not want this to be his reaction however I don't see any other choice....I feel so powerless to protect my son whilst he's at school and this is the only way I can see to help stop him being a target.

Does anyone have any advice on this or any experience of something similar? Im thankful for the rant so its much appreciated if you read....just hoping my lo is safe at the moment :( xxHello allI just had to come and post this thread for as much my own sanity as for getting advice so if you read and can offer any words of advice its all much appreciated!Yesterday I had to go and collect my son from school as he had been thrown to the floor in the playground by the class bully (that he was a bully was unbeknown to me before this)  and landed straight on his face, suffering from an extremely swollen nose and eye.  The teacher assured me when I collected him that this would be dealt with by not allowing the bullying child out to play for two days and he had to write a letter of apology to my son.

Howeve, the same child gave my daughter hassle and then a death threat again by indicating hand round the neck for not bringing in sweets. 
I've not been able to get to the school before today as not been able to drive and can't trust school if I phone or for daughter to take in letter as she forgetful. 
I caught up with the teacher tonight and she said she will talk to Child after stats test! But will tell temp head as well. I've for acknowledgement from parents and was told this.is nothing To do with his parents so they have nothing to do with this or giving an apology?? All parents are responsible for their children and they action, are they not??? Or only when government can make.money???
Also as it happen last week, then it's my fault for not reporting it. Altho I was hoping she might be able to forget it, but found our she got in a panic again after my sister told me at the weekend. 
Also teacher gave the impression that as there had been a gap in between incidents then he will get away with it. 
What happens if this kid hurts someone now or later in life?? It's ok.

Deleted profile,"It depresses me to write this as DD is only 5 yo and experiencing the sort of bullying I would associate with older children, so I'm at a bit of a loss as to how to respond.
DD entered Reception with a few other girls from her old nursery, among which she had a good friend. Now six months on, her friend has befriended the class 'alpha female (AF)', who makes my sensitive DD feel a bit inadequate as (in her perception of things) she seems to be the best at everything, but this girl isn't the direct source of the bullying. 
DD's old friend apes everything AF does, from having the same lunchbox, shoes and swimming towel at school and mum (whom I consider a friend) is quite indulgent, taking the line that 'what she wants, if it makes her happy and fit in with others, is what she gets'. I take a tougher line, rationalising that blindly copying and competing with others for the sake of 'fitting in' is just a recipe for low self-esteem and it will never stop. Or am I overreacting? 
It does not bother me that DD has been replaced by AF in this friendship, as all this competing is not healthy and kids move on, I understand that. I have also tried steering DD away from this group to play with other children, play-dates, park meets and that sort of thing which have gone well, but back at school DD only seems to want to hang around with this little gang (there are a couple of other girls in this group, but the core is her friend and this girl). 
But what is worrying me more is that when my DD tries to leave this group to play with others (as myself and others have been telling her to) she is threatened with 'I'm going to tell on you' to the teacher by her so-called friend. Why is unclear, and I have tried to persuade DD to call her bluff and answer back with 'Go on then!' but she says that she will then make her friend upset, and then the teacher will have genuine reason to believe the other girl. She also thinks walking away will bring the same reaction, and at her age cannot understand this is the best thing to do, even if it does upset the others. So in a way, she is being blackmailed to stay in their group. 
The teacher is vaguely aware ..she is very experienced and when we spoke a couple of months ago she said DD had to be encouraged to make new friends but this was before the emotional blackmail started. I have tried talking to the mum in a casual way 'how is X getting on at school etc?' but have not broached this blackmail issue because she is liable to take it the wrong way (I've seen her in action over a parking incident and have reason to be nervous:shock:!). 
I know I am prone to worry, it is in my nature and my daughter is of a sensitive disposition. I don't want to escalate it into a big deal and everyone to fall out, but nor do I want my DD to have her self-esteem trampled on at such an early age.

Any advice from anyone who has experienced anything like this would be much appreciated.",2,"1,259", 30-04-2015 at 1.34PM  
Liz C(535),"My son has started secondary school, he was betrayed by his primary teacher because they made out secondary school to be great, but its not, its hell on earth, there are fights, breaking out ever break time, bullying, there are places around the school where kids have extremely bloody fights and places where the kids smoke, the youngest smoker is 11.
My son was introduced to this gang of kids that said that are training to fight, one kid, age 11/12 was covered in blood., thankfully, my son walked away and has told a teacher, though I very much doubt the teachers would do anything to stop any of it, I have no faith in that school

KM (4),"Hi 
Trying to keep this short as can be My child was attacked at school on Monday , 
When School originally called me they said said she had her face slapped and hair pulled.
My child was left with severe bruising and a whiplash like injury to her neck I called them and said sorry this is a assault and you better take it more seriously , after hearing I had reported incident to police and had my daughters injurys recorded at local hospital where I was told to keep her off for rest of week,they said they were taking it seriously but couldn't contact other child or mother as child had run out of school after incident and not come back in following day. I was told to leave it to them and they would call me in for meeting later on in week where they would take my crime ref number , look at pics of injury's and they would note my concerns .
 
Incident was caught on cctv and showed it was a unprovoked assault where daughter was put in headlock and dragged by her hair around a foot ball pitch by extreme force.
School took every student they saw on cctv out of lesson to write a statement.
The girl attacked my daughter ,because my daughter asked her not to call her friends sick mother the c word!
Mother and child were called into school Wednesday eve for meeting.

I never got my meeting I got a call yesterday to say all dealt with, girl has been excluded three days and told not to contact my daughter or face serous consequences ( what like 3 day exclusion) that's it , they have told her she is not allowed to harass her on school bus either.

My daughters neck is still jarred today she has not yet been able to return to school ,im taking her to a chiropractor today to try and help with movement. This means that already my daughter has had more time off from injury than the exclusion ?!!
This girl has a violent history and is already on a anger management course ( which clearly isn't working )she ran out of school after attack but was on school bus at end of day abusing my daughter so she doesn't sound like she actually cares about what teachers say, infact after attack he was screaming at teachers I don't give a F* what I done .

Is it me or is this a really lame punishment , im left with a injured daughter who is now saying she doesn't want to go back to school and to be fair I don't blame her ,even if I get her to go in ,I cant send her on bus its unsupervised its like they want me to play Russian roulette with my daughter. If girl approaches my daughter how do I prove it , its word against word.

Its like she is on cctv , she admitted attack ( because she was told its all clear on cctv) but assault isn't assault when it happens at school, the police told me at start they wont arrest due to her age, what they do will be depending if she has previous , but they like to leave stuff like this to school , this was before we knew it was on cctv so didn't know it be blagged as a fight , but he did make me feel silly for reporting it so im not holding much hope of them doing anything .


Its mad if this happened on street it would be assault , if it happened at work , they would be punished at work and be arrested for assault , but at school its 3 days off that's it .

Is there any thing else I can do her or am I fighting a losing battle. I feel like girl is a ticking time bomb who cant control herself when she gets angry why should other children have to be around that and risk being attacked.

Dan81yim,"Asking on behalf of my sister for some advice on how to deal with this situation.
On Wednesday, my 8 year old niece ran home hysterical and told her mum (my sister) that a man was shouting at my 6 year old nephew and was shaking him.
Both children were playing in a park with other children in the next street so My sister ran around to find my nephew crying with children consoling him. One older child explained that my nephew and another boy had gotten in to a fight and the boy's father came over screaming at my nephew and shook him before slapping his face.
My nephew had a bright red mark in his face and had peed himself with the fright of the incident.
My sister took the children home to her partner then went over to speak to the father. He was very aggressive to my sister and shouted at her he would 'leather' her son.
She was very shook up and contacted the police who came out and took her statement but weren't allowed to speak to my nephew due to his age. They told her there's not much they can do about the incident!
Any ideas on what to do next? My nephew and niece are too scared to play outside and sister is worried the man will retaliate.Asking on behalf of my sister for some advice on how to deal with this situation.On Wednesday, my 8 year old niece ran home hysterical and told her mum (my sister) that a man was shouting at my 6 year old nephew and was shaking him.Both children were playing in a park with other children in the next street so My sister ran around to find my nephew crying with children consoling him.

Kim10jgr,My daughter is being bullied at college this started nov2014.. she ignored it at first but this just made things worse it progressed to social network sites which she deleted from her phone. Then there was a physical threat which was reported in college and to the police.. College suspended the perpetrator for three days. The police said anything else report again. It went quiet for about a month now has started again the girl shoved my daughter off a chair last week which was reported again to the college. They said they would deal with it so we didn't report to re police. Three days later nothing has been done today my daughter was abused again today leaving college but still on the premises. I called the college again and was advised it would be dealt with again I asked what they would do and was told the perpetrators will be pulled in and told that this behaviour is unacceptable... I personally do not think this will work. My feeling is why should my daughter be abused whilst walking through the college this has happened with witnesses there in the corridor in cafeteria in the grounds of college. If anyone has any advice as to what I can do now I'd appreciate it.. I have asked the college to keep me informed either by email or by phone. My daughter is saying she does not want to attend college now and her work is suffering. She has previously tried to take her own life because of this bullying. And I am at a loss as to what to do as a parent and also what I should expect of the college.My daughter is being bullied at college this started nov2014..  she ignored it at first but this just made things worse it progressed to social network sites which she deleted from her phone.

family members have told me to ring the police, I did ring the school this morning to tell them that I didn't want these vile disgusting boys near my sons but head master and deputy were supposedly in meetings the receptionist said they would phone me back they never bothered.

I would hate to have it thrown back in my face that this child can't help it but on the other hand he is in a normal school so surely should be all treated the same?

I used to do nice days out in the holidays, took a handful of kids to the park, zoo, retaurants, theme parks...most of those girls never once invited her back!! why? never even been to their house, in 6 years?

she has had 1 best friend and the friend has same situation, nobody invites her either! they are not cliquey, they try and play with others, but get turned away alot, from groups, there are only 2 large groups of girls that all inite each other and play together. She is not a bully, she is gentle and kind, there is no reason to dislike her. I am not just saying that.

she is know at the secondary feeder school, same issue as primary as almost the same people there.

for 3 years, not been invited to a single party.

I had enough and in year 6, I just stopped saying hello and chatting with these parents upon drop-off, not sure if a consiracy or how things turned out, but just cannot see how it went so badly wrong. I mentioned in passing and in a general way, the issue to a couple of the relevant mums, saying she does not get invited back and they outright lied and said oh we hardly see anyone ourselves, which I know is not true, they have regular playdates and days out in the holidays.

I think I mind more than dd, I think she minds a bit but she has a best friend so is not completely alone.

I know it sounds strange but I am wondering why I bothered treating their kids to stuff, so ungrateful, turn up, take what is offered, palm their kids off on me for the day and not once invte back and say hello and small talk with me still.....dd was always dropped off by me but picked up by grandma, she stays at grandmas for an hour and grandma cannot do playdates, dd ws never inited after school, I cannot expect it i suppose, but people knew I work and grandma has her.I used to do nice days out in the holidays, took a handful of kids to the park, zoo, retaurants, theme parks...most of those girls never once invited her back!! why? never even been to their house, in 6 years?she has had 1 best friend and the friend has same situation, nobody invites her either! they are not cliquey, they try and play with others, but get turned away alot, from groups, there are only 2 large groups of girls that all inite each other and play together.

Claudia B(24),"Hi
I don't know where to start really. My son who is 7 and currently in year three is being bullied by another boy in his class. It is mostly verbal but there have been a few physical episodes too. The boy in question started the school in year two and took an instant dislike to my son. I've been into school numerous times. They finally agreed to move the boys onto different tables in class although it took them forever but to most people that would have been common sense. Boys in same football team and also same Beavers group. My son not sleeping and is like a shadow of his normal bubbly gorgeous self. Saw headmaster many times but too husband when I saw him this week. He seems to see it as our problem because Thomas is 'too sensitive'. We disagree totally as he isn't the only sensitive child in the world. He said Thomas rarely mentions anything during the school day and we explained that was because he feels nobody listens. He also suggested to us that perhaps Thomas needs counselling to toughen up which is absolutely ridiculous. Nothing wrong with him. He is a perfectly normal little boy who up to now has been perfectly happy. Yesterday he was pushed and shoved a lot into a nettle bush and when I picked him up he was so so upset. His legs were covered in nettle bites. He was upset this morning so we have kept him home today. I did speak to school governor last week who said to log everything and she will also mention it but I'm in despair as to what else to do. We are contemplating a change of schools but not convinced that would be right for him. I've approached the bully's mum who won't listen as her son can do no wrong. I'm at a loss as to know how to get Thomas his happy little life back. Is keeping him home wrong?

lu 80pbt,"Hi,

My gentle, loyal girl in Year 7 came home from school today without the 3 friends she had planned to return with. Something had changed during the day and they were all suddenly 'busy', with one of them literally running away from her after school. It broke her heart and she rarely cries.
I have been there, it is the bread and butter of some girls so I can't stop this and I know that in the grand scheme of things you'd better get used to this. Even in my 40's I'm still getting hurt by girlfriends who can freeze me out for no reason. She is at the age when talking to her mum is maybe not what she wants to do, so I am imagining that there is some great literature out there for her. A book to empower her to be who she is, to cry as it does hurt, but move on and not let herself be a victim.

Does anyone have any suggestions?

thanks

Deleted profile,"My year 3 dd is being intimidated and threatened by a year 6 boy. He is the 'problem' child in the school and for various unfair reasons is targeting my daughter in particular. This has been threats to beat her up, put her in hospital etc. Everytime I complain he is told off and is currently on report again but it still doesn't stop the glares at my dd or making gun shooting gestures to her when no one is looking.

Sat30kiw,"Hi any advise welcome! My DD is 9 years old. She's not the most confident child and has low self esteam.we live in a rural area and she attends a small village school. the school is so small that each class contains two year groups she is in year 4. I have a fried who lives about 1/2 a mile away. We met at toddler group have have remained friends every since, she has two DD who anre in year 5 and 3. So her youngest is in the same class as my youngerst. Her daughter is the comple oposite to mine. Shes confident bossy doesn't care or worry about anything or anyone. Because my friend and her husband start work early a couple of years ago i agreed for them to both be dropped off at mine so i take them to school three times a week. This has carried on and i still ferry them even though i now work and my eldest catches a bus. 
Anyway i ramble...... We decided to enrole my DD in to a dance club on a Saturday. She lives dancing and i'm sure with a bit of encouragement and support she could really enjoy it. We thought it might boost her confidence and self esteam. She was apprehensive at first worrying about making new friends etc but went the first time on her own. Anyway my friend heard about this and her eldest decided she wanted to do dance. She started and it was fine until she invited her best friend from school so they partnered up. Then her youngest started and paired up with my DD. Last week her you gest invited one of my DD friends from her year so my DD was left out because her friend didn't want to upset my friends daughter. She also told my dd that she would be pairing up with the other girl every week and not my dd.She came out crying. What started as just my daughter doing dance has now resulted in her being dropped by both my friends DD. 
I don't know why i should be supprised as i myself have been dropped when someone or thing better has come along by my friend. Some time ago she asked my daughters round for tea and then when another parent asked her children round the same day she dropped mine!
I called her last night stupidly when i was upset and i ended up sobbing down the phone. I said that my daughter had felt dropped and upset and that we had taken the decision to change her dance day. My friend said she was sorry for how my dd felt and that she would have a chat with her. Then she commented that she felt left out becaue me an my other half had been invited out by some other parents and had other friendships that shes not part of. I've never left her and her other half out. I've always invited them when we have gatherings. She even comented once to a different friend of mine that she didn't like my circle of friends. I now feel really rubbish and don't know what to do. Shes due to drop her girls off tomorrow morning. To be honest its getting a real pain to sort two extra children out in the mornings now i'm working too! Help and advise needed am i being mean or unreasonable.

amanda d(305),"Hello, ive not written on here before but i just dont know where to turn. My daughter is in secondary school and had faced bullying by a group of boys. Basically last week from monday to wednesday it was constant, nasty personal comments, things about her family and told numerous times to go and kill herself. It was even going across the classroom in front of the teacher, my daughter asked the her what she was going to do about it, and she replied &#034;why what are they doing?&#034;. My daughter cut her face and all her wrist in the school toilet. She was taken to the school councellor to talk about things. The school didnt inform me of her injuries that occurred on school premises. Luckily she came home, confided in me and has not tried to harm herself further. Took my daughter to gp and being referred for councelling. I emailed the head teacher, briefly told her the situation and asked that she meet with my daughter and i to discuss the bullying, find out what they would be doing about it and give my daughter some assurances to feel confident about returning to school. For five days i emailed the school, and called and left messages on voicemail,but no response. On the sixth day the school councellor called me to say she had already established with my daughter that she would counsel her. She told me she had no authority within the school. I asked why a teacher at the very least had not been the one to call me to discuss this if she had no authority. I asked why i hadnt been informed of my daughters injuries and she said with self harm they never tell parents, only report it to outside agencies. She then went on to say while my daughter is in counselling she could be cutting herself for months and i wouldnt be told about it. Lovely touch. I told her that i wanted to meet with the head, she kept swerving the subject. She said i should just send my daughter back into school! I was calm but frustrated so i told her was ending the call as i was getting no where. Still getting nothing from the head, I applied for an in term transfer to another school and contacted the education welfare services to tell them what was going on. Today i called the school to ask what their complaints procedure is and i got called back straight away by the head of languages(?) who wanted to meet me to talk. I agreed but mentioned that id put in for a transfer and she said&#034; sometimes a fresh start is for the best&#034;. My daughter doesnt want to go back now, and this is all too little too late. So i dont think i'll bother seeing this teacher now. Im concerned my daughters missing out on her learning and im worried what will happen if shes out of school for too long. Will i get into trouble?

A few months ago i reported to my sons teacher that my son ( 8 ) was being bullied by a fellow student ( 8 ) both verbally and physically. I saw and witnessed incidence myself. She advised me that she would address the issue. He has now come home with an incident letter saying he has bumped in left cheek and to alert me of any complications. He has a bruise on his face. On questioning it turns out this boy 'accidentally' punched him in the face. The boy was not punished.

I am sick of this schools incompetence.

But the last 6 months or so i find she is lashing out at other kids bigger than herself and targetting ones smaller also. It seems to be tge newest member in her group she moves to. I simply cant ignore wen she is physically marking the other children like her. Its heartbreaking to see. As she is usually a very pleasant lil girl. I dont want her been a bully but also dont want her bullied for been different or for her disability. Also she always looks at me while doing it. Like she wants a reaction.

Hazel M(78),"Hi

My daughter is being harassed at school by another girl in her year. This has been going on for a while and each year we have to point this out to the new teacher. HOwever, at the moment it is quite bad to the point of my dd not wanting to go to school. What happens is my DD gets followed by this other girl and made to feel guilty about playing with other children, this other girl cries and says that my DD has made her sad. As my DD doesn't like upsetting people she goes and plays, she has now tried to make new friends and this other girl has now &#034;made friends&#034; with the same kid. 
We have written to the Head on Wednesday and not had any response from her. 
The teacher has just said we'll have to wait and see what happens next week. 
This is very frustrating as a parent to see that the school isn't really doing anything, understand its hard to deal with as its not physical but it needs dealing with. 
Where can I turn next if nothing improves.

J G92rkj,"My child is currently having hard time at school. A small group of girls are verbally bullying her on a regular basis. As she was getting upset and withdrawn we have spoken to school. School have spoken to the girls involved, but this appears to have no affect, if anything the meanness is becoming more frequent. Although school have put in place a reporting system for her she doesn't always report things as she doesn't want to be seen to be a grass.

I've thought about moving schools, but she doesn't want to, her confidence is so low at the moment I think she would struggle to break into a new friendship group and is likely to come across these girls in the local area anyway.

She does lots of outside activities and has friends there.

I don't know what to do next, it's breaking my heart.

Ano12lng,"Hi guys,

Completely drained and need some advice.

Last month I picked up my DS from.nursery to find he had been attacked by another boy. My DS had deep scratches all over his face, some which have left scarring. Nursery had written it down in an accident book but had advised it was an unprovoked incident in a group of boys, in which the attacker was uncomfortable with the playing situation (they were in soft play a group of about 4 children) and lashed out at my DS. The boy who did this is 6 months older with a speech delay but no signs of autism etc.. 

Gutted as I was I was reassured it was a one off and they would be keeping an eye on the boy who did it.

Fast forward to this afternoon and its happened again. But deeper and more blood :-( again, group of kids playing, my DS picked up a toy which the other boy wanted and so he lashed out at DS's face. I managed to have a meeting with the owner who was admittedly gutted. However it turns out this boy lashes out quite frequently to a lot of the children!! She said some kids will push him away, some kids now won't play with him but a few -my DS is one of them- will just keep trying to play with him and sometimes he won't lash out until they do something to displease him??!!

I'm gutted and have advised I want some disciplinary action put in place as the owner admitted they boy is getting worse as he's getting pressurised from parents, the school setting and outsider helpers to get his communication up to speed before he starts school in September, and that they can't exclude him as his violence is his way of dealing with his frustration from his speech delay.

But what I don't get is apparently he's not like it at home?? And that although they admit they aren't seeing progress right now from him, I should take comfort he will be gone In September!! But they cannot answer me when I ask why a nursery on a whole should run risk of violence because of one pupil!! 

I'm gutted because I feel I'm left with looking st other nurseries for my son when he's done nothing wrong, nor have the others he attack's.

I then as I left witnessed the boy push another boy over quite hard. I may sound ignorant but surely you cannot overlook frequent violence because of a speech delay?? His brain works fine, he understands people perfectly.

Anna L(249),"This all started before the summer break last year, my son was told and passed notes of extremely rude and pornographic things by a boy in class and told if he told anyone he would kill him. This to us extremely concerning. When I finally managed to contact the HT (after threatening to contact the Bishop and local education dept due to her lack of response) and explained what had happened the HT kept telling me how she did not think this boy was capable of such things but to leave it with her and she would deal with it. 

So a few days later my son came home to tell me that he and this other boy were called out the class and my son was interrogated in front of this boy as to what happened, this didn't sit well with me! Anyway the boy apparently cried and said sorry. So I hoped this was the end of it not that I was happy how it was dealt with.

Just before Christmas my son starts acting strange and it turns out this same boy is now physically hurting my son, again speak to the HT and again disbelief that this boy is capable of this!! Told to leave it with her and this will be sorted. In the mean time my son is getting very anxious doesn't want to go to school and developed a tic. Nothing happened.

So next I speak to his class teacher again surprised the boy behaves like this, wasn't aware of the situation HT hadn't discussed with her but will get it sorted can't stand bullying and very sorry. Two days my son came home and tells me he and boy concerned we were called to HT office together and had to talk through with each other what had happened. So the other boy starts crying, says he cant help it as his big brother bullies him and treats him like a slave and thats why he he treat my son like this, he's sorry and it wont happen again etc So my son tells him that its ok he should have spoke to him about it and they could if worked it out together, he has a bigger heart than me! HT speaks to me explains this tells me how mature my son handled the situation and she believes that will be the end of it. 

But what I don't understand is how the school is happy that this boy that is a bully has now made himself the victim and my son is physically and mentally affected by this has to support him through whatever tale of woe he comes away with. They think everything in the garden is rosy.

Over the last couple of weeks a change has started with my son again and he tells me the same boy (that nobody believes can do any wrong) calls my son a snitch and a cry-baby. 

Where does this end has anyone experienced similar. This is really having a major impact on my son and I am terrified the horrible little boy picks up on my sons tics and makes his life in school even worse.

Would be grateful for any feedback.
Thanks

Ton65jnv,"Hi All

I just wondered if I could have your opinions please. 

To put you in the picture my little girl has been attending nursery school since she was a year old, we then moved out of the country and she had to attend a foreign school with a completely different language spoken and now we are back in the UK and she has been attending the local nursery since the end of January. She seems to cope with change well and has never given me any cause for concern.

The week she started at the local nursery she told me another girl and called her 'a baby' throughout the day and I brushed it off thinking 'kids will be kids'. I have seen this little girl and she is twice the size of mine and has a very strong character. Yesterday I collect my daughter and she says that this girl has pulled her hair, pushed her over and thrown play dough at her during the course of the day. 

This morning (for the first time ever) my little girl said she did not want to go to school :( I am so annoyed that someone has had this effect on her. I spoke the the team leader/manager this morning and was told that 'my daughter did not have her hair pulled and was pushed over because the kids were playing a big game' she sort of brushed it off said she would keep an eye on it and hurried off.................since when have games involved pushing and shoving!!!

The dilemma is that this is a small village the staff are really clicky with the girl's mother. I am contemplating moving her out of the nursery but she is enrolled to go to the local primary school in September (thankfully I think the other girl is enrolled somewhere else).

I'm just not sure if I am wrapping her in cotton wool or whether I am justified in thinking the way I am......

Sorry for such a long post and a bit of a moan but at 3 and a half she has so many more years of schooling ahead of her I really don't want her put off now.Hi AllI just wondered if I could have your opinions please. To put you in the picture my little girl has been attending nursery school since she was a year old, we then moved out of the country and she had to attend a foreign school with a completely different language spoken and now we are back in the UK and she has been attending the local nursery since the end of January. She seems to cope with change well and has never given me any cause for concern.The week she started at the local nursery she told me another girl and called her 'a baby' throughout the day and I brushed it off thinking 'kids will be kids'. I have seen this little girl and she is twice the size of mine and has a very strong character. Yesterday I collect my daughter and she says that this girl has pulled her hair, pushed her over and thrown play dough at her during the course of the day. This morning (for the first time ever) my little girl said she did not want to go to school  I am so annoyed that someone has had this effect on her.

Lin55sqf,"Hi all 

My DS is in Y2 and is a sweet-natured, big-hearted, kind, gentle, caring little boy. He has a small group of good friends and is always happy to go into school with a smile on his face. He is naturally quiet and is comfortable within his own skin so the last thing I want to do is suggest he needs to be something he isn't, or that what he is isn't enough.

However.....as school life develops, he is increasingly finding it difficult to stand up for himself and I am concerned that he is starting to potentially become an easy target. I wouldn't want to use the term 'bullying' as yet as I don't believe he has been on the receiving end of persistent behaviour from any particular child. But there are several things which happen regularly from someone taking the pen off him (because there's wasn't working for example), or pushing in front of him in queues so that he then doesn't get a turn etc. Today, during P.E, DS was in goal and didn't manage to save a ball. Another boy in his class went up to him and said, 'Get out' (of the goal). DS asked 'Why?' and the boy said 'Because you're rubbish'. DS complied and the boy chose someone else to go in goal whilst DS just shuffled off and got on with the game. I had to ask where the bl**dy teacher was in all this, letting another 7 year old organise the game but still.....the point is that he doesn't have the assertiveness to stand up for himself so he just lets this stuff happen. I find myself saying 'Why didn't you just say XYZ?!' but I also know in my heart that it's just not his personality and it's difficult to ask someone not to be themselves.

I want to show that I support him and am not trying to change him and that I love him unconditionally but also am worried that this behaviours / characters are starting to get 'set' now he's in Y2 and that he's going to be typecast as the one that bullies can pick on from an early point.

Any advice greatly appreciated.

joanne r(185),"I am having a problem with my 10 year old.
I love my daughter with all my heart but I can't deal with how she is turning out. 
She has had a bad attitude for a while now but it is getting to the point were I have had trouble at my door recently. 
I am a single mum to 4 children and the other 3 wouldn't dream of hurting anybody (even my 15 year old isn't as mouthy has my 10 year old).
She is a wonderful intelligent little girl but she can be lazy with her school work and ends up in homework club every week because she can't be bothered with getting on with it at home (she has even had the same school reading book since September). I do sit with her at the table to try and help her and the older children have also tried to help her with her work but she waits for us to give her the answers which obviously we don't do.
She has showed attitude towards teachers in front of me too.
There is another little girl she hasn't got along with for a while and they almost got into a fight on Saturday. A lady I knew came out of her house and asked what was going on and my daughter shouted 'what has is it got to do with you'. The lady then said 'don't talk to me like that or I will go and see your mum' My daughters reply to that was 'my mum will just get social services on you and have your kids taken off you' 
My daughter ran into my house and told me what had happened and thought I would laugh about it. I told her it was wrong to say things like that and I didn't find it funny that she disrespected an adult.
I am not used to confrontation and I hate the thought of not getting along with people but the lady was at my front door really upset about it and started shouting. I told her I don't want to fall out with anyone and agreed that my daughter was completely in the wrong and I grounded her. The lady said she wasn't angry just shocked that it was one of my kids and she was used to seeing them being polite and kind.
I spoke to her headmaster on Monday about the girl she almost had a fight with as they are in the same class and I was concerned something would happen in school. I said I was worried that it was my daughter that was being the bully but I also knew that this other girl was quite sly. I just wanted them to either get along or stay away from each other.
The head teacher called them both into the office and tried to sort it out. He asked them if they could try and be friends. the little girl said yes, my daughter said no chance. 
My daughter as been telling me for months that she doesn't get along with any of the girls in school (the teachers have said she does), she doesn't like them because they are stuck up but I can't help but think that she is being a bit stuck up herself and I feel really guilty about this.
I won't tolerate bullying in my house and I have always drilled it into my kids that I don't like bullying, lying or disrespecting others. my other 3 seem to be listening but my 10 year old doesn't seem to care.
I feel like I am telling her off all the time and I don't like that either. I have told her that I will always stick up for her if someone is being horrible to her but I can't just sit back if she is the one being horrible.
I was bullied for 5 years in high school and my older 2 have been bullied too (my son is still going through it and my daughter is still having counciling and has been diagnosed with severe depression and high anxiety) so she understands what bullying can do to a person. I always spend time with my kids, they all have the same amount of chores, they are all disciplined if they are in the wrong. Although they are treated the exact same way I can't help but think I have gone wrong somewhere down the line. 
I don't know what else to do with her to make her realise that she shouldn't be behaving this way. I have even asked her if she has a problem with anything that I can help with in case there is something I haven't clicked on to but she said there is nothing. She just stares at me with a certain look, like she is laughing at me when I do tell her off. She knows it annoys me too.
I am sorry if this is long but I am so worried that she is the bully and that it is only going to get worse. She has another year to go before she goes to high school so I want it sorted before then. I want my kids to be able to stick up for themselves but I definitely don't want them to be the cause of these problems.I am having a problem with my 10 year old.I love my daughter with all my heart but I can't deal with how she is turning out.

Bev88irq,"My child has been suffering what I would call bullying for about 2 years. Name calling, damaged personal belongings and even some physical incidents. The issue I have now is that she is having outbursts of temper at home and at school. My DD is 9 and has always been a very happy child full of energy and attitude. Since returning to school in September she has started to argue back with the mean girls at school and for a while even done silly things they told her to do. When she has an outburst she is so vile, she says the meanest of things to her family, throws and kicks things and it makes no difference who is stood in front of her. After she has been left for a while she will get very upset(tears) and is very sorry. She has trouble sleeping, goes to bed in her room but by 1am is camped on my bedroom floor. On Saturday evening she even said she felt like putting a plastic bag over her head. I feel as if .the school are no longer listening as she is now being mean to the mean girls, We have tried to explain that while she behaves like that she is letting the bullies win but pretty hard to make a 9 year old understand this. I have requested a referral to the school nurse as we really can not go on like this. My friend suggested she could be stressed, Could her behaviour be a result of the last 2 years. I just want my little girl back.

Ann31lgl,":(
He's 7, &amp; goes to a school in the next village.
I have suffered badly with social anxiety in the past, &amp; still struggle to mix easily with others. One of the reasons my children go to school a few miles away is that I knew I'd struggle to live in such a small community (we moved here when my eldest was a baby) &amp; it was a coping mechanism for me.
My children both enjoy school &amp; do a lot of other stuff, but mainly together as there's only 18 months between them and they're both boys.
They used to go to Beaver's in the village where they went to school, but when my elder son moved up to cubs he didn't like it, so we started sending him to cubs here, there was no space in Beaver's, so my younger son has been waiting for months to join. My elder son is quite quiet, but settled in at cubs straight away &amp; loved it, he's done lots of things &amp; has made a few friends.
When we went to watch my younger son get invested at Beaver's tonight at the end of the session, I saw a few of the other kids pushing him so he couldn't stand in the circle, he came to me with his eyes full of tears &amp; said he had no where to stand, so I told him to find another space, but it happened again so he told one of the leaders, who let him stand by her. Then as he was called to the front to be invested a big group of the boys were laughing and saying his name in a stupid way, &amp; I could see he was getting upset again. Then when he'd got his stuff another kid got right in his face &amp; told him he wasn't in his group, &amp; my son ended up having to argue back that he knew...they just didn't have the right colour stuff.

I'm not sure what to think about it, I work with young children and have high expectations of their behaviour, it really surprised me that none of the adult leaders stopped the other children being mean, or pushing my son about. 

I talked to him about it afterwards, but he says he still wants to go. He's not a quiet child, like my eldest son, or like me, &amp; he's big &amp; boisterous with a really funny, sunny nature, so I'm struggling to understand why he's finding it harder to fit in than his brother. 

I know it's not a huge deal, but it's hard to see my own son get pushed about, it happens at work all the time &amp; gets dealt with...&amp; I think it upset me more seeing adults who are meant to be in charge, &amp; are meant to be promoting good values, ignoring pretty horrible behaviour.He's 7, & goes to a school in the next village.I have suffered badly with social anxiety in the past, & still struggle to mix easily with others.

Ame02chu,"This all started with a disagreement between me and one parent (to which that parent escalated it between the rest of the parents) over 2 years ago.

My daughter has continued her dancing because she did like it at the time. She has now written a letter to the dance teacher stating why she want to leave, first couple of answers being that it is boring and she isn't learning new thing (this is due to them being put in with a younger group). The last answer though has really got on my boat!

Number are:-
4. I am getting bullied
5. Nobody is being nice to me.
6. Every time I do a dance somebody says I have done a move wrong.
7. When I try talk to two people they walk away and I know they hear me because later on I hear them talking about it and saying how funny it is.

At first when my daughter had told me about them walking away I took it with a pinch of salt because I know sometime if they are not enjoying something they will try anything to come out but I seen this with my own eyes one day. Now to read this it is heartbreaking that she is thinking like this.

I had decided a few weeks ago that as she isn't enjoying it she can give it up when it finishes for Christmas but she would have to stay in the competition classes so as to not let other children down. Now reading this though I am tempted to just take her out altogether.

What would you say to this? Do you think I should go ahead and take her out completely or make her stick those classes out until the competitions are over. I don't want her to be bullied any longer. She is in gymnastics which she has stated is her life.

Thanks in advance for any advice, it will be much appreciated.This all started with a disagreement between me and one parent (to which that parent escalated it between the rest of the parents) over 2 years ago.My daughter has continued her dancing because she did like it at the time.  She has now written a letter to the dance teacher stating why she want to leave, first couple of answers being that it is boring and she isn't learning new thing (this is due to them being put in with a younger group).  The last answer though has really got on my boat!Number are:-4.  I am getting bullied5.  Nobody is being nice to me.6.  Every time I do a dance somebody says I have done a move wrong.7.  When I try talk to two people they walk away and I know they hear me because later on I hear them talking about it and saying how funny it is.At first when my daughter had told me about them walking away I took it with a pinch of salt because I know sometime if they are not enjoying something they will try anything to come out but I seen this with my own eyes one day.  Now to read this it is heartbreaking that she is thinking like this.I had decided a few weeks ago that as she isn't enjoying it she can give it up when it finishes for Christmas but she would have to stay in the competition classes so as to not let other children down.  Now reading this though I am tempted to just take her out altogether.What would you say to this?

Jac45zhr,"We have just been to soft play and my daughter just came over to me and told me a little boy was trying to strangle her. He had his hands around her throat. 
Needless to say I told this little brat off, his response was &#034;I don't like girls&#034;. I was so cross I got up and left. 

I ask my dd what she did to stop him doing it and she said nothing, I came over and told you mummy. Obv I praised her for this, but I asked did you push him away or anything and she said no. 

She is such a kind girl and this doesn't surprise me she did nothing, but how on earth can I install in her that it is ok to defend yourself in those circumstances? She does not retaliate and this is not this first time I have worried about her. 

Any ideas on how to make her &#034;braver&#034; is welcome. I feel like crying my eyes out. Since when did bringing up a kind hearted, wouldn't hurt a fly child such a bad thing? Maybe I should have brought her up to be a little brat, then she would stand up for herself!We have just been to soft play and my daughter just came over to me and told me a little boy was trying to strangle her. He had his hands around her throat. Needless to say I told this little brat off, his response was ""I don't like girls"". I was so cross I got up and left. I ask my dd what she did to stop him doing it and she said nothing, I came over and told you mummy. Obv I praised her for this, but I asked did you push him away or anything and she said no.

Jay57wat,"My daughter just turned 6. An older girl in her class (let's call her X) has been unpleasant to her at times. Yesterday my daughter told me &#034;I've put some chocolate in my schoolbag to give to X so she won't hurt me&#034;. Apparently X gave her a small gift (a plastic trinket which I also found in the schoolbag) and then told my daughter she must now bring her in chocolate or else she will &#034;hurt her&#034;. 

I phoned the headteacher. He did not seem surprised to hear about this behaviour from this child. He says he will do work in Circle time regarding gifts and asking your parents before you give them to other children and regarding threatening behaviour and &#034;trust&#034; (?). He says he and the teacher will speak also speak to X individually and return the &#034;gift&#034; for us.
Is this enough? Is there anything else I should ask them to do? 

What would you tell your child in this situation? The messages I've been trying to get across are i) No one should ever ask her to keep a secret from me or her dad ii) Anyone who tells her something bad will happen if she tells us a &#034;secret&#034; is lying iii) It is very wrong for anyone to say that they will hurt her in any way.

Am I on the right track? Any advice gratefully received....My daughter just turned 6. An older girl in her class (let's call her X) has been unpleasant to her at times.

Jes39nfc,"My little boy is 4 years old he will turn 5 in march and started reception in September. He hasn't had many issues since starting yes he occasionally has had falling a out with one or two friends but then a week or two later they were friends again and that's what children can be like relationships up and down. 
My child has a learning and behaviour delay and we believe and others believe he has a learning disability which the paediatricians and teachers are in limbo about as he shows some signs and some he doesn't so a lot of the time I hear let's just wait and see and review him at a later date or it could be we don't see the problem till he's older which makes me furious because the system is letting him down as he's not getting the help he needs so is behind at school! 
He's such an over friendly loving boy he wants to be everyone's friend gets along with everyone...he can be a bit hyperactive at times which I have seen can irritate children or put them off of him occasionally (this being out down the the learning and behaviour delay he has). 
He loves playing with older children as all his cousins are older than him, he played with everyone of all ages at his preschool older or younger he is a general all round boy who will get along with anyone of any age but it's how these other kids take him that makes it difficult.
The autumn half term he told me and I noticed he kept playing with the big children on the playground (year 1s and 2s) and often when I asked him how was playtime and who did he play with on the playground he would say the big kids...then he would go on to say they kept trying to hit me and chase me and I don't like it...he also spoke of this one girl who he says he doesn't like (she is an older girl too) who kept trying to take his hat off of him and push him around.
Since after Xmas we have drilled into his head to not play with the big kids as they are too rough and mean and he is only little and he has listened and doesn't play with them barely anymore but says he still sees them and they're mean! I spoke to his class teacher about this last week and we tried to get my son to tell us the name of the older children which he doesn't know and we constantly tell him he needs to tell a teacher or adult on the playground when someone's scaring him or upsetting him...but he just doesn't seen to grasp what we are asking him and his understanding is significantly behind aswell with no diagnosis made still so everyone is stuck in limbo as of if to deal with him. 
His teacher did say if she finds out who these children are she will go on the playground and speak to them etc. 

But another situation that's ongoing that had happened since after Xmas the last 3 weeks back at school is some trouble with a boy in his own class who is the same age as him. 
My son gets along with a certain boy called Alex and this boy that is causing some trouble naming him tom had so started building a good relationship with Alex recently and I could almost sence a bit of jealousy of my son and Alex's relationship going on. My son would come home and tell me about 3 weeks ago Tom said he isn't my friend anymore and I would ask why and my son would just say because he said so...my son can't explain himself well as he also struggles with this too. 
Then when I was in the cloakroom talking to my sons teacher about a different matter one morning 3 weeks ago I noticed that this boy tom was encouraging Alex to put my sons school lunch box (it was brand new spiderman the same as toms lunch box) on the bottom shelf hidden from the rest of the lunch boxes which to me is rude and spiteful! Didn't think children could be spiteful at this age!! 
I brushed it off and asked my son that afternoon did he get his lunchbox ok and did anyone move it and he said no it was fine no one touches it now. 
Then just over a week ago the teacher pulled me up saying Ethan was told off today for being disruptive in the hallways with a few other children and there was a bit of a scuffle. I then noticed she spoke to toms mum saying the same thing too. I asked my son what happened and he said it was tom he wouldn't let him play and he punched my son in the stomach and my son hit him back. And then I have noticed since when we were waiting to line up in the mornings that this tom boy kept following my son saying I'm not your friend, your not invited to my birthday party. And my son who doesn't really understand when someone is being nasty to him and when to tell a teacher just ignores him and walks away looking a bit confused and lost :(:( I always tell him don't play with children who are mean to you tell them to leave you alone and tell a teacher and they will tell the other child off...but saying all of this is infective with my son as his learning delay/disability just causes things to not click in his brain and understand what it is we have explained. 
He has come home and said the last week everyday that Tom says he isn't my friend still when I try to play with him and now Tom has gotten his friend &#034;luke&#034; who my son is friends with to say to my son he wasn't friends with him either! And yesterday I priced my son came home all muddy and I asked what happened and he said he was trying to stand and look at a drain cover with his group of friends on the playground and Thomas pushed him away and he fell in the mud which has made me angry and I asked my son of he told tom that was wrong and did he tell a teacher and he said no to both! 
This morning waiting to go into class one of the boys my son plays with on the playground from the other class was looking at some stickers of toms with a few other boys and Ethan quietly when up to them didn't say anything and was just looking and I noticed tom was looking at him saying something probably u can't look at these and my son just covered his face and got upset and went shy...and then in the Que this tom boy tried to push in front of him adamant he was going to get in front of my son who wasn't having any of it so toms mum told tom off and said u go to the back u don't push in that's someone else's place. 

My other half is getting really annoyed with this matter and says do he has to take time off of work to come into the school to speak to this parent and the teacher if this isn't dealt with it isn't going to be pretty which I don't blame him for saying.
But I don't know if you would class this as bullying with both the older children and this child in his classroom...or is it just taunting or something else...to me it's leading towards bullying or a very light form! 
I don't know if I should speak to his class teacher again this afternoon and explain this situation wit the boy in his class and demand that this is closely monitored and for someone to monitor my son on the playground as this is where a lot of the picking is happening with both the older children and the boy in his class.
I know about the anti bullying policy and know the process but I just know they aren't monitoring the children well in hallways and toilets and on the playground. My child says this doesn't happen in the classroom when they're learning and I have been in the class to help a few times and they both do they're own thing it's just when it comes to mixing with eachother and other friends in play and other areas this happens. I feel my sons being isolated from specific people. Because of this boy in his class...
If someone could give me advice on how to approach this what to say to his teacher and what they're opinion on this is I would be extremely grateful.
It does make me sad that a lot of children with learning disability are subject to bullying because they are different and don't know when someone is taking advantage of their kind nature :(:(:(My little boy is 4 years old he will turn 5 in march and started reception in September.

Ann12ryi,"My son is 11 years old, in year 6. There is another boy who has always been in the same class as my son and last year they became quite good friends. The background story with this boy is that he had a chaotic home life and was last year taken into care and put with foster parents. It was around this time my son became close with him, although they had always been within the same friendship group, he felt sorry for him and was a good, supportive friend to him. I encouraged this relationship as I also felt extremely sorry for him and he came to our house on many occasions. He is a nice likeable boy. 

On the last day of year 5 my son was devastated as this boy was leaving that school and starting year 6 at a new school in the area he was living in. Anyway, he did not end up moving schools and started again at my son's school in year 6 and is now with new foster parents. My son was initially pleased about this, however, he is now making my sons life a misery! 

Almost straightaway at the start of year 6 my son was coming home saying he wished the boy had moved schools as he was constantly being unkind to him and falling out with him for no reason. I advised him to just ignore it and reminded my son of the difficulties in this boys home life etc. there were further incidents with my son advising he had been pushing and shoving him and falling out with him again, basically being horrible to him and trying to put him down and humiliate him in front of others in their friendship group. he had reported this to the teacher who apparently dealt with it. 

However, the week leading up to Christmas my son was increasingly unhappy saying he hated school, he was again having problems with this boy and our tactics for dealing with him, such as ignoring him and telling a teacher if he needed to were not working. My son said that the boy didn't seem to get into trouble like anybody else would if they were doing the same thing and he was being allowed to get away with things others would get in trouble for and it was just continuing. He also told me him and another boy were having to pretend not to be friends as this boy didn't like it when they were friends! I told him he shouldn't have to do this as he could be friends with whoever he wanted. He was also trying to get others from the group to fall out with my son. 

The day before end of term my son came out of school extremely upset and angry, he said he was sick of it, no matter how much he tried to ignore this boy he was going out of his way to be nasty to my son, trying to make others fall out with my son, calling him names, deliberately mishearing things my son was saying to get him into trouble and/or as an excuse to fall out with him, such as my son saying &#034;ok&#034; he would turn around out of the blue and say &#034;you just called me gay&#034; My son said the PE teacher had pulled the boy up on it and said &#034;it seems like you're constantly trying to get xxx into trouble by deliberately mis-hearing/changing things he's saying&#034;. 

My son was so frustrated and I offered to go into school. He didn't want me to as he thought it would make it worse and he would be taunted for it. I left it and hoped that after the Christmas holidays things would be ok, which hasn't happened. upon coming out of school on Friday the boy and the other boy mentioned earlier (who he had to pretend not to be friends with) were shoulder barging my son into the fence, there had also been other problems throughout the day which he had reported to the teacher. My son was again upset, angry and frustrated. I went into school to discuss, the teacher was aware and basically played it all down, it was friendship difficulties and they were all as bad as each other. 

Now I don't for one minute think my son is perfect, however, I can tell this situation is really getting to him, he no longer enjoys school, he's seems so stressed and angry and frustrated, he feels powerless and like he isn't being listened to. When this boy is pushing and shoving him, all he wants to do is turn around and whack him one but knows he would get into stage 3 (any physical violence including pushing) which is detention and me having to go in so he doesn't and instead tells the teacher, like they're supposed to do (the schools policy is stage 3 even if they have hit/pushed you first as violence not the answer, must tell a teacher) yet this boy isn't getting into stage 3 for doing it to him and its continuing, which is causing my son to be resentful and think &#034;well why shouldn't I do it&#034;

I have never in the whole time of him being at school had to go in to discuss a friendship issue, I understand kids fall out and make up and have always left him to it. This just seems different due to the affect it is having on my son and the negative emotions it's causing. Any idea what's going on here? I understand this boy's circumstances may be coming into play here and my son is mature enough to understand that but even so, my priority is my son and his happiness. 

What should I do? I'm worried about my son's well being and concerned that he is just going to take matters into his own hands if it doesn't stop.

sar13jaw,"How far does someone have to go for it to be classed as cyber bullying? My 8yr old daughter has an iPad, which is controlled by me. I teach her to text sensibly, not to text or FaceTime after a certain time, not to talk to anyone she doesn't know etc. She has friends same age with Ipads all with parents that that do same as me, except one, this friend is a 9yr old girl. Although in the same school, they don't play at school together, just outside due to living on same street. There is a gang of them and this one particular girl only sems to be a problem. Little bits started over text message, and then a couple of things in person (didn't hurt my daughter, was just unkind) this I thought was just kids - they do fall out occasionally and then sort it out. But it's got more and more. There too many incidents to say on her but If she does not get her own way she takes it out on my daughter, she has sent a horrid recording of herself a couple of months back with threatening I'm not playing with you I'm deleting you, doesn't sound much but it is upsetting for an 8 yr old to receive something like that. A couple of weeks ago, when my daughter had a friend for a sleepover - this girl was texting and texting her but I said don't reply, she then sent voice messages one after the other 5 secs long with horrible things, and also threatening to come round and 'get her' and tell her off with an older couple of girls. Next day messages came through calling the friend we had sleeping over, then the next day she was round our house as if nothing happened and asked if she could sleep I said no and then she posted pics of my daughter titled 'baby' on snapchat to different people at their school. My daughter was devastated and worried so much was sick, and didn't want to go school after the half term. I have spoken to the parent who commented that my daughter is a bit sensitive.... Now I have seen a message that was very inappropriate sent to my daughter only to be followed by another message 'sorry that wasn't for you' - It was meant for a boy - and it was something a 9yr old girl should not really be saying ! We are having horrible messages sent now every day to her iPad, always starts off nice then turns when my daughter has to go or doesn't want to play out. Blocking here will obviously stop the messages, but I can't help feeling that this girl needs to be told what she is doing is wrong, before it goes to far and I am concerned for her safety on line. Is this something that the school will take serious if I now report to them? Or will they see this as girls just not getting on. I don't know what to do for the best. I do wonder if I'm making it out more than it is, it seems this girl has issues when can't get own way and is jealous I don't think she means to intentionally bully my child, but really threatening messages and voice messages are a form of bullying and it's becoming more frequent and could get worse.How far does someone have to go for it to be classed as cyber bullying?  My 8yr old daughter has an iPad, which is controlled by me.  I teach her to text sensibly, not to text or FaceTime after a certain time, not to talk to anyone she doesn't know etc.  She has friends same age with Ipads all with parents that that do same as me, except one, this friend is a 9yr old girl.  Although in the same school, they don't play at school together, just outside due to living on same street.  There is a gang of them and this one particular girl only sems to be a problem.  Little bits started over text message, and then a couple of things in person (didn't hurt my daughter, was just unkind) this I thought was just kids - they do fall out occasionally and then sort it out.  But it's got more and more. There too many incidents to say on her but If she does not get her own way she takes it out on my daughter, she has sent a horrid recording of herself a couple of months back with threatening I'm not playing with you I'm deleting you, doesn't sound much but it is upsetting for an 8 yr old to receive something like that.  A couple of weeks ago, when my daughter had a friend for a sleepover - this girl was texting and texting her but I said don't reply, she then sent voice messages one after the other 5 secs long with horrible things, and also threatening to come round and 'get her' and tell her off with an older couple of girls.  Next day messages came through calling the friend we had sleeping over, then the next day she was round our house as if nothing happened and asked if she could sleep I said no and then she posted pics of my daughter titled 'baby' on snapchat to different people at their school.  My daughter was devastated and worried so much was sick, and didn't want to go school after the half term.  I have spoken to the parent who commented that my daughter is a bit sensitive.... Now I have seen a message that was very inappropriate sent to my daughter only to be followed by another message 'sorry that wasn't for you' - It was meant for a boy - and it was something a 9yr old girl should not really be saying !   We are having horrible messages sent now every day to her iPad, always starts off nice then turns when my daughter has to go or doesn't want to play out.  Blocking here will obviously stop the messages, but I can't help feeling that this girl needs to be told what she is doing is wrong, before it goes to far and I am concerned for her safety on line.  Is this something that the school will take serious if I now report to them? Or will they see this as girls just not getting on.  I don't know what to do for the best.  I do wonder if I'm making it out more than it is, it seems this girl has issues when can't get own way and is jealous I don't think she means to intentionally bully my child, but really threatening messages and voice messages are a form of bullying and it's becoming more frequent and could get worse.",4,"1,298", 04-11-2014 at 10.19PM  
Mic61wqg,"Hi :nmswave: I'm a newbie to this site so please hang in there with me.
My son is a very bright, happy, boisterious 6 year old but recently since he has changed from year 1 to year 2 and they have swapped the classes around he had started to become very quiet, emotional and clingy.
I first thought maybe it was the change from years, also we had moved house, so new year, new area may take abit of time for him to adjust. We had parents evening everything perfect, made me feel so proud! But since October 3rd he is getting worse, quiet, not wanting to play,etc. I have discussed with him at great length number of times whats the matter and he just used to get very angry,upset and go to his room not wanting to speak. I spoke to the teacher and she had noticed nothing and apparantly the dinner ladies had not noticed anything. 
Then last week he literally broke down and cried and cried for about 2 hours about a boy that keeps calling him stupid, an idiot, crap at everything, smeels of poo and has told everyone he wees the bed. Which i have tried to explain over and over again that this little boy is not a friend and try not to take notice or it to heart, but seriously i do not know what to or to say!:sadhug
I have consulted the teacher and she basically told me, bullying does not go on in their school and said that he was lying!:s This child is ruining my little boys days at school and is now making him a little boy i do not know anymore! Please could anyone give me advice on what to do in this situation, as im getting very angry with the school and really want to just confront his mother, but obviously i know that is a bad idea! It breaks my heart to see him like this and now its getting to a point where i want to just pull him out of that school!
Please help if you can as i cant keep watching my son go throught this.Hi  I'm a newbie to this site so please hang in there with me.My son is a very bright, happy, boisterious 6 year old but recently since he has changed from year 1 to year 2 and they have swapped the classes around he had started to become very quiet, emotional and clingy.I first thought maybe it was the change from years, also we had moved house, so new year, new area may take abit of time for him to adjust.

catherine a(11),I'm worried about my son he's 8 and in year 3. Someone in his class keeps calling him names and he even slapped him on the face today. He said sometimes the teachers don't believe him and the boys said he's said things to him before. I have been told my sons not been listening and messing around in class a lot. But no excuse for the other boy to bully him. Sometimes i think about changing school but he has a couple of friends and likes the Childminder who can only pick up at that school three times a week. I just think it doesn't help I'm quite shy to and quiet when it comes to knowing what to do. Its been happening a while now it really winds him up and gets him upset. When i spoken to the teacher before Christmas she said my son needs to ignore him not get involved and get on with his work not get distracted. My son said he doesn't call him names back. Going to speak to his teacher in the morning but feel like she won't take me seriously.I'm worried about my son he's 8 and in year 3.

Sum55dpc,"Hi Moms,

Greetings. I am new to this forum and found this useful forum while i was searching for bullying prevention information. Suprisingly, there is a lot of information on how to stop bullying AFTER it has happened and how-to-stop-your-kids-negative-behaviour, but not much info on 'how to prevent your kids from being victims', which is what i need help for.
My 4.5 yr old, preschooler, I would classify as meek. While he is talkative and smart enough, his behaviour since am observing from 2 yrs, is very submissive. I hv mostly observed his behaviour in playground and with his friends. He is not able to react when somebody pushes him, or gets him away from a swing forcibly. He doesnt react and just gets off. While group play, I almost all the time see him robbed off his fav toy, and he gives it meekly, even though he still wants to play with it. This happens whether he is playing with his friends in their house or in his own house. And even with children who are younger to him.There are numerous such things I see when he is in a group.
I hv tried much since a year to make him stand for himself, telling him things like saying to his friends - No, I still want to play with the toy, or await your turn etc. but nothing has helped.
It really is a pain to see him at the receiving end.More so, am worried his being a visible target for bullying.
I am in need for suggestions how to prevent this early-on.I mean I can see clear symptoms here, but how do i get help other than home? At school, his teachers say they havent noticed anything (I dont blame them, its a short time 2.5 hrs, plus closely supervised environment).

thanks much

Ano52rpd,"Very long post sorry, but i just want you to understand so you can give me advice! (also a family friend) has changed recently. We have noticed she latches onto one person then she doesn't need anyone else. Lies and tries to create a wedge between them and other people. Now my daughter is 7, very popular and has a lot of friends In and out of school. Considered very sweet, caring, motherly and special by loads of people (not my words) I am not a parent that sees their child to be perfect and can only find faults In others. I know my daughters faults but she is a very well behaved sweet child. This parent however feels her child can do wrong at all, it has always been like that from the beginning. Her children are always the victims, but there is a reason a big group of 5/6/7 years olds all get on but aren't fond of her children. Over time I have noticed out of school, her child is a lot cleverer then she makes out. The way she talks is like a typical 15 year old (she's 5) lies, exaggerates, never does anything wrong. From birth to even now she has never slept through the whole night, every morning she cries when her parents drop her of so it takes them a while to settle her, has never eaten properly or anything. I have distanced myself because I can't cope with the lies, jealous behaviour and acting up. Because her children are perfect it's never dealt with they are just getting more cleverer with what they do/say. Now apparently my daughter is victimising/terrorising and treating her child like a slave at school and because of that she is having night terrors, waking up In the middle of the night and is petrified of coming to school because of my daughter. The parent has told other parents (not in same school,just circle of friends with same age children) that it has got that bad the school are dealing with it. It's 2 months later and I have just found out from my sister. It is upsetting and hilarious at the same time. She has failed to mention her children have never slept the night since being born and has failed to mention her child has got upset every morning since starting reception till now and her child is In y1 and still gets upset. She saying it started from when my daughter has started bullying her, now these are some things my daughter apparently does 1. Makes her stand in the playground holding my daughters things whilst my daughter plays and she is to scared to do anything (children aren't allowed to take books and toys from class room so where has my daughter got them from to give you) my daughter is in y2 by the way. After school she has to hold her stuff until we arrive and I have been the parent that's there 10minutes early and her class comes out first and my daughter comes out last so she is usually gone by then. I asked my daughter and she said once she had too much stuff after school so asked her to hold a book whilst she got all her homework in her going home bag and she just put the book on the bench and went of (and surprise surprise told her mother something else) and her mother being so crazy has took it so far telling my mum and the circle of friends. Now obviously if this is going on for months with the school then I would have known by now so I'm certain there is nothing to report and another reason I'm sure it's ok is because whilst she has been telling people how bad the situation is and how petrified her child is on seeing my daughter, she has sent her 5 year old down the road to my house asking for am ingredient and then allowed her to play for hours without even checking on her, even came to my daughters birthday absolutely fine, we even went out as a group to a play area her daughter was holding my daughters hand and playing fine, what do you guys think? I am going to the school because she has said these accusations and said the school are dealing with it because it's such a big situation even though i know there is nothing.

Kat (45),"So I've written on here a few times documenting the bullying my daughter goes through in School.
Rachel is 10 and has suffered at the hands of a few folk in her class.
Things like tripping her up in class to humiliate her, throwing bits of paper at her, calling her ugly, smelly and they wish she would die etc etc.

Today she was walking home from school - we live down the hill from school so I meet her at the bottom with our dog.

A group of 7/8 kids chased her from school shouting at her and when they caught her they threw ice blocks at her ( we have had heavy snow - turned to ice)
Saying to her you deserve this, take this, die ***** :( 
She managed to get free and hid in a bush till they had gone. At this point I was frantic wondering where she was so ran up the hill and found her cowering in a corner soaking wet sobbing while other ADULTS walk past her!!!!
Managed to console her and find out what went on, got her home and warm to discover she has a black eye, bruised nose, bruised fingers (where she's put her hands up to defend herself) 
I immediately informed the school and they are seeing my husband and I on Monday morning. However my husband has cone home from work as soon as I called him and he's called the Police. He says this is so much more serious and has happened out of school so something needs done. I'm in totally agreement with him although I'm concerned it will cause more problems for our poor baby :( 
Police are due to interview my daughter tomorrow and she's worried sick. She's white as a ghost, sore head and absolutely heartbroken and scared.

What would you do?
I'm constantly on at school to deal with it, we are in process of involving a support worker through the school to support our daughter.

Worried sick about my poor poor baby.

For a bit of background,I have 3 children in school aged 8 and 6yo twins &amp; am pregnant with baby number 4. today my eldest has brought home a letter from school which has totally dumbfounded me, apparently all 3 have attendance this academic term(since sept)that is below par and is to be monitored closely, now firstly I must stress that my children barely have any time off at all, I should know as I work in the same damn school! Secondly I think they have drawn the numbers from the fact that they had 8days off in total since sept because of a virus that they caught that was spreading through a LOT of the children. There have even been cases of whooping cough because a parent decided to send their child to school knowing that they had been diagnosed with it! Our school has recently changed to an academy and had a new headteacher. I'm very unhappy with the way things are being dealt with and am very tempted to seek legal advice I'm that angry and upset by it. Our school has a very diverse culture and no questions are asked or threats made when some children have to take leave for 6 weeks at a time, I'm not suggesting they should be questioned but what I would like is to see some fair treatment! My children do not seem to be able to have genuine sick days without myself and my husband being treated like criminals!!

Jil10maa,"My 12 yr old had been diagnosed with Dyspraxia and has been bullied since day 2 of his time in High School. We have had meeting after meeting after meeting with his head of year, welfare officer and senco but nothing has changed. Our son is still miserable, lonely and isolated at school and the bullying continues to happen daily. Last year they did next to nothing to help him (apart from talking to the children who bullied him on occasion). This year (after diagnosis) they have put a few things in place, for eg setting up a chess club a few lunch times a week to allow him to have somewhere to go during down time, allowing him to go a few minutes early daily to stop him getting caught in the crowd, including him in a 'talk about' group that meets occasionally &amp; introducing us to a families first representative. The daily core bullying problems continue to be ignored. I cant help but feel they try to pacify me with telling me they will sort it out but then do next to nothing to deal with the issues that happen on a daily basis until they escalate out of all proportion and my son gets hurt or beaten when really things could be nipped in the bud as soon as they begin. 
talks with the school broke down this week. there has been a group of children who have been bullying him relentlessly for a while now. i spoke to the school and told them if it continued i felt sure my son would end up hitting one of them (he takes all he can before he explodes). this week thats exactly what happened, a kid shoved my son and my son punched him. my son is the one that has gotten into trouble (for punching first even though the other kid started it) the welfare officer said my son wrote 5 lines whilst the other boy wrote a detailed page (my son stuggles holding a pen and writing). they have put him in internal isolation for a day. they sent me a letter saying we have to attend school to have a reinstatement meeting before he can go back into class. i have refused to go as i dont feel i can speak with them any longer, i have also refused to sign anything. off the back of this my son went to school today and they put him in isolation again stating it was because i refused to go into school and they say he will be in isolation until I go in. I feel as though they are almost blackmailing me into going in. 

some examples of what has happened in the last 14 months include:

having to move form classes within the first 3 months of school because 2 boys picked on him so badly that everyone in the form class started to ignore him and eventually nobody was speaking to him which resulted in him sitting alone.
choked on the school bus, 
has had a lighter flame held to his hand on the school bus by an older boy after another boy told him he was weird, 
has been beaten up (4 boys included in this) as 1 recorded it on his mobile phone (police involvement due to injuries), He was off school for 4 days and when he went back the boy who recorded it still had it on his phone and was still bragging about doing it
numerous fights as he is seen as a soft touch and kids feel like they can score 'brownie' points by hitting him, 
pushed down the stairs (school deny this happened)
punched in the face on the bus and come home with a bloody nose.
kicked (to the floor) in the chest, face and head on the school bus by an older boy (police involvement due to injuries), 
a huge group of children chanting 'pedo' at him (after we had complained time after time about random children calling him this it took a large group of kids being caught doing it for them to act), 
a group of children on 2 different buses that call him names on way to school (nothing done apart from a talking to), 
a group of boys banging his head against a post on the bus until he cried, 
having a nail like metal object thrown at him on the bus, 
online bullying (threatened to be beaten up the following day in school/warning to keep quite - this boy is the same boy that recorded the beating and the nail throwing as as far as we are aware no punishment has every been set out), 
the same 2 girls who shout and swear at him regularly on the school bus, 
a group of kids splashing him with water until soaked through. 

These are the incidents i can think of off the top of my head. im sure there are many more.

The worst punishment the school has given to the children in the above has been a 3 day suspension and that was for the older child who choked him and the child who beat him up whilst it was recorded on the mobile phone. 
 

it seems as though they wait until things escalate and get really back before they deal with the problems.

I have contacted Parent Partnership and I am waiting for them to contact me to see if they can help. 

In the meantime, do I go into school to get him out of isolation or do I wait until I hear from Parent Partnership? can they really keep him in isolation under these circumstances?

Lau00kvi,"My 9 year old daughter is being bullied at school. This has been going on since year 2 when I went and spoke to the teacher. I told the teacher not to tell my daughter or the bully I had spoken to her: The very next day she did exactly that, spoke to both of them. The result was &#034;you told your Mummy&#034; jibes for my daughter and a lack of trust towards me.

She has been bullied on and off since by 3 girls. They exclude her and don't let others play with her. I want her to be able to trust me at least so when she asks me not to tell the teacher I cannot break that trust.

The school denies any bullying happens there and they are supposedly rated &#034;outstanding&#034; in all categories by OFSTED. However I know others are being and have been bullied, some parents have even moved their children to different schools. Their way of dealing with bullying clearly doesn't work.

Bam11xwr,"I tutor children under the age of 7 in English as a second language. One little boy I tutor is having a difficult time in school. I've spoken to his Mum about it a couple of times but I'm not sure if she has spoken to the school yet. I pick him up after school for his lesson with me and, as I can't speak much French, I'm not able to speak to his teachers to find out what's going on.

Sometimes he tells me that the other children are 'mean' to him. When I ask what they do, he says that they push him or won't let him play. He had a class photo that he was showing me and when I asked who his friends are, he became very upset and said, 'no one is my friend.' It broke my heart!

This little boy can be quite difficult. He can be very bossy and becomes upset and agitated if something during play time doesn't go his way (if you pick up the wrong toy, for example). After working with him for a couple of months, he's fine with me now (no longer bossy etc). However, I can understand if some of the other children have become upset by his outbursts but it's strange that his teachers aren't noticing his behaviour or that he isn't interacting with other children.

When I pick him up from school, all of the other children will be busy playing in groups but he stands away from them, usually not doing anything. Or, he drifts from group to group, just watching them play. It's really sad to see.

There was a period when he was having accidents in school as well because he didn't want to tell his teacher that he needed the toilet. His teachers weren't noticing anything. I would pick him up from school and he would have dirty underwear and would be very quiet and upset. His mother told me that I should tell him off when he does this but I refuse to do that. Instead, I give him positive reenforcement when he asks to go to the toilet with me and I reassure him that he doesn't need to be afraid to tell his teachers. This seems to have worked as he doesn't have accidents any more.

However, for me, it just shows how useless his school is. I'm angry with his teachers for not noticing any of this (it makes my job difficult at times, particularly when he was having accidents during school as I would then have to clean him up after). I'm also angry with his mother for seemingly not doing anything about it... I have told her about how he seems isolated at school and she shrugged it off (sort of like, 'kids are like that.').

I thought perhaps I could sit him down the next time he tells me he's upset as he has no one to play with and I could suggest ways in which he could integrate with his classmates. He's four and English is his second language but he does have a good, basic understanding (I'd say his English is 90% there, for his age - he's not as fluent as he is in French yet).

Kar94iux,"I've tried to decide in my own mind whether this constitutes bullying or if it's just a symptom of growing up and learning how to deal with new friendships in anew environment and added responsibilities.
Maybe someone can offer some advice or opinion that might help me decide what to do..... 
My DD had a fantastic time at at her infants and junior schools. She had lots of friends and involved herself in anything she could get involved in, both in and out of school. Yes she had a few spats along the way but never anything that hadn't been forgotten about by the next day.

The story since joining secondary school has been very different. She has made a lot of new friends in the last year and a half (only a couple of her primary school friends are at her secondary school) and in the first few months of Y7 I assumed the spats were the same as before and getting resolved as soon as they occurred. 

But there have been a few incidents that now I add them all together are worrying me - after one spat she posted a message online saying she hated her life - my 16 year old niece saw it and called me immediately - we talked about it and sorted it....I thought. More recently DD is often in tears after school and she seems to be getting quieter and more withdrawn / disinterested in her activities.

We have avery open relationship and she does talk to me about any problems she has, and they always seem to stem from ******, girlie, backbiting and falling out with 'she said this about me, eveyone hates me, I didn't say that...' kind of stuff - which I have always tried to encourage her to ignore and find other friends that aren't in the 'cool' gang to hang out with. But more often than not as soon as we have had a chat about it she's back in the friendship again and they're round at the house right as rain and it all gets forgotten for a while.

Today she came home distraught. Someone (a friend!) decided to bring up a conversation she'd had with them months ago when she's fallen out with someone who she is now 'best friends' with, telling everyone that she's said she wasa nasty person etc etc. Anyway,she has admitted to me she said these things in the heat of the moment (who doesn't after a row) but knows how she will reaact when she finds our and tomorrow there will be the usual whispering, laughing, stares, exclusion etc. and so really doesn't want to go to school.

We had the 'ignore them, you're better than that, you don't need friends that don't support you etc etc' conversation but she's so upset and I'm getting really fed up with it. I know it's all quite pathetic kids stuff and nothing compared to the real bullying that goes on, nad I am starting to wonder whether its something she just has to learn to manage or if it's a form of bullying. 

But I don't want to see her so miserable any more, it breaks my heart, and i'm considering taking her out of that school but don't want to feel we are just running away from the problem.

Towards the end of Year 7 after the message posting we visited the school and saw the head who was good and listened and was concerned and offered some possible solutions but has since left the school. I was never confident that they were the right solutions though as I wasn't convinced that it wasa bullying issue but more of a settling in/finding her feet kind of issue. But I feel it has been going on for long enough now and if I am in a position to do something to change her mental state then I must before it's too late and she's spent all her school life hating school.

But am I kidding myself? Does this situation happen in all school and isjust part of growing up? I dont remember this kind of stuff from my schooling days but was I just lucky? 

However, as she pointed out today, none of her old friends are having these issues at their schools....or are they but are too afraid or embarrassed to admit it?

Any views???I've tried to decide in my own mind whether this constitutes bullying or if it's just a symptom of growing up and learning how to deal with new friendships in anew environment and added responsibilities.Maybe someone can offer some advice or opinion that might help me decide what to do.....

But I don't want to see her so miserable any more, it breaks my heart, and i'm considering taking her out of that school but don't want to feel we are just running away from the problem.Towards the end of Year 7 after the message posting we visited the school and saw the head who was good and listened and was concerned and offered some possible solutions but has since left the school. I was never confident that they were the right solutions though as I wasn't convinced that it wasa bullying issue but more of a settling in/finding her feet kind of issue. But I feel it has been going on for long enough now and if I am in a position to do something to change her mental state then I must before it's too late and she's spent all her school life hating school.But am I kidding myself? Does this situation happen in all school and isjust part of growing up? I dont remember this kind of stuff from my schooling days but was I just lucky? However, as she pointed out today, none of her old friends are having these issues at their schools....or are they but are too afraid or embarrassed to admit it?Any views???",3,922, 24-10-2014 at 2.56AM

Luc50wwa,"Hi everyone, 

I'm new to this website so please bare with me :)

I have a little boy called Jacob, he turned 4 in July and has just started full time School in reception class. 

Cut a long story short - Jacob is a little bit behind with his speech and is being put forward by the School for speech therapy. He is very bright and on track with everything else - he just needs a little help to get his speech on track. 
His Teacher said that sometimes it can be quite hard for her and the other children in class to understand what he is saying. 

Anyway, today when we got to School before the bell rang Jacob walked up to 4 children from his class and said hello - they all said &#034;no it's Jacob!!!&#034; And ran away from him. He then came up to me very upset and said &#034;the others have ran away from me&#034;. He's also said that some children call him for wearing 'baby pants'?! (He wears normal pants not boxer shorts). 
I am now wondering if they are they picking on him because of his speech and saying he's a baby?..it all sounds so petty but it's heart breaking seeing your child so young going through this.

I have telephoned his Teacher today and have explained my concerns but she said that Jacob has lots of friends (mainly girls) and she hasn't seen any form of bullying/targeting happen. 

When I picked him up from School at home time today he told me that a girl in his class has punched him in his back and told him that she hates him!! I can't believe kids this age can be so mean! I am in shock! Jacob is such a polite, happy little boy and I don't want School taking his confidence away from him.

Has anyone else been through something similar? Should I keep him out of School whilst he's having speech therapy and send him back when he can speak a little clearer. (I can understand him clearly by the way it's only the Teacher's concern). 

Any advice would be grateful!

El L(3),Today I had a neighbour waiting for me saying my 12 year old had been assaulted on his way home from school. My son was knocked off his bike on the floor and banged his head kn the concrete. The boy then jumped on top if him a c grab his hair and then started slamming his head in the ground. Other kids tried to stop it but couldn't. A passing police van stopped and grabbed the boy and threw him in the back of the van and took him home. My son ride home. I have reported the assault to the police. What sort of punishment should the school take as I have had problems with them in the past. I think he should be permanently excluded but no doubt they won't. What is reasonable from a school point of view ??Today I had a neighbour waiting for me saying my 12 year old had been assaulted on his way home from school.

hel32sok,"Hi
Apologies firstly this will be a long post.

There have been a few incidents at where my ds has been told off by teacher for doing something mean a couple on his own and a few times where he has been in a group of four others... Now when this has happened he has been punished both at school and home. It has been the same little boy on the receiving end all times. 

Now I don't believe my child to be a bully, he plays lovely with his brothers at home and when he has friends over he plays very well too, never been any issues or behaviour that I would consider wrong.

The teacher and I agreed that she would give me a thumbs up/down at the end of school day to say he has been good or needs to talk. Over the last week and a half it's all been thumbs up and my ds has had a couple of extra awards too in this period in class. Now last Thursday I received a call from ds teacher stating that she has to inform me that 1 parent has reported a complaint against my ds for bullying their child.... Yet as far as the teacher and I are aware nothing has happened in this same period she is complaining about ! I have even been questioning my child every day even though the teacher said he has had a great day to see if he mentions any arguments him or his friends and he says nothing has happened.

I am so upset and left the school run in tears today ... My ds was excitedly jumping next to said child asking to play 'it' this child who states is being bullied then ran off with just my ds and started to play it... The mother was watching them looking at my child as if the devil had just appeared when I turned to her and said they are just playing it she retorted with that's not what they were doing ?? So I replied 'no they are just playing it' to which I received a mouthful of I am so fed up with all this I had to keep my child off school Friday because of my son.. 

So this child is going home each night and crying in the mornings stating my ds is bullying him yet myself and teacher have not seen any evidence of this from the kids.

Last year this child stated another was bullying him and it caused a huge issue between the parents and that child now goes to another school as the mum got so distressed on school run she was actually dropping and collecting from reception not a classroom.

My heart goes out to this child BUT my ds is at the moment being excluded and seen as a horrible child (the parent has been talking to others ...) when he has done nothing wrong. He was not invited to another child's party, this child told my ds that he wanted him to come but his parents won't let him cause he is naughty ! My ds was devastated.

I am wondering whether this child is getting more special attention at home and getting to stay at home instead of going to school because he is lying about my ds... My ds is no angel he is like very other 5yr old but I am now getting quite distressed and upset about the whole things.

Has anyone had any similar experiences please would really like advice on how to handle this I am feeling such a frosty reception in school run and I really don't want my ds to be excluded and blamed for something that is not happening.

Any help/advice really would be appreciated

Deleted profile,"DD is 11 and has been having problems with bullying for quite some time. The school seem to have a few real 'problem' children. I have complained frequently but it doesn't see to have gotten me very far. On Friday I had a meeting at the school and took in a list of some of the bullying incidents which have occured just in this school year and made it clear that I will be sending a copy to the school governors. 

There is a particular problem with a child who is technically not in DD's class but she shares many lessons with him. He pushes and shoves her in corridors, calls her names, even in lessons. He called her a moron in a lesson last week in front of the teacher. He threatens to beat her up frequently. He has attacked her at the bus stop and on the buses home from school but school say that as it's not on their premises there isn't anything they can do.

I told DD on Friday to wait at school for either I or DH to collect her so she wouldn't be on the bus with him but she forgot and automatically got on the bus and he pushed her, punched her, pinched her...she said she couldn't get off because she was near the back and the bus was absolutely packed. He then threatend that if she returned to school on Monday he would kill her. I called the Police and they have said they will get in touch with the school on either Monday or Tuesday but I don't want to send her in. I don't trust the school to keep her safe. Even if I take her in and collect her, he could and has attacked her in school and probably will again and the staff have been as much use as a chocolate fireguard.

I am breaking the law if I keep her off school but how can I send her back into this? I suppose I should move her to another school but then he has succeeded in what he wants and the school can absolve responsibility. I am so p***ed off it's unreal.DD is 11 and has been having problems with bullying for quite some time. The school seem to have a few real 'problem' children.

ste28exu,"Since moving into my new property last year , my 2 sons have been allowed to play in the street with the other children who live in the street too. I thought it was great that they were mixing with other children as they couldn't play out in the street in our old house.

Any way as times gone on the lady who lives across the street has 2 older girls , one of them 12 and starting high school this year . Each and everytime them girls are playing out my eldest whos 7 always comes in crying because the older sister has done or said something to him to upset him.

One time he even came in saying the mother had told him to keep away from her house or she would be phoning social services . I was furious but I let It go. I know it got said because my son wouldn't just run in crying saying this, hes never even heard of social services.

Then another time the mother was stomping round her car and my son was sat on our wall outide my house so I shouted him in because I knew one of my kids was going to get the blame again with them been the new kids in the street. 

Any way yesterday I went to call my boys in too hear the eldest screaming at the bottom of the street. I went down to find all the kids had sticks and he had been hit with one by this older girl across the road. I told him to lift his top and he had a big bright red mark. So I thought I know kids are kids but enough is enough . I went and knocked on the mothers door and said all the kids are playing with sticks at the end of the street and my son had been hurt with one by your daughter I thought you should know. Wel she started flapping her arms and stomping past me saying no your son this that the other . I lost my temper then , all I wanted to do was talk to her civilised but after she had said something to my son about social services she was already in my bad books. We had a heated row to which she describes my kids as the bad batch of the street and no one likes us and if her daughter wanted to hurt my son she would as she has a black belt in karate. 

She also said that the all the children in the street wont stop playing together just because we have moved in and that my son is the bully and he does this because hes learnt if from elsewere/ home . I was livid and still am how dare she discriminate my kids like this. 

There is about 6 children who played together in the street for years before we moved in and once something happens there quick to stick up for one and other and quick to blame my children because were new here. There even saying there were phoning the police on my 5 year old for scratching her car because the other kids said it was him.

I was so angry and still am , is there anything I can do to stop me and my family treated I this way just because were a new young family in the street ?Since moving into my new property last year , my 2 sons have been allowed to play in the street with the other children who live in the street too.

Danielle S(503),"Hiya, I have a 3 year old little boy who is very sensitive but akso extremely happy and chatty one day at nursery (he was about 2 and a half at the time) he was bitten by a boy he would often tell me he has been playing nicely with. When I say bitten I mean huge purple and black bruise, teeth marks, broken skin and tiny bit of bleeding. I know it may sound like an exageration but honestly, it was awful. I wish I had a picture to show. Anyway I went to pick him up amd his key worker said to me 'hes been bitten today, but its alot better than it was' &amp; my son didnt seem distressed so I just said 'ah well, atleast your ok now' when I got him home and saw I was so shocked but didn't make a big deal. Then my son just cried and said it hurts so much, he wanted my crayon! For the next few days he wouldn't wear a tshirt only a jumper and didnt want anyone to see it and was scared to go in the bath and just kept crying about it it was heartbreaking. He just kept going on about it. When I next took him to nursery he just kept saying 'is he going to be here today?!' &amp; asked all the workers there too. So I spoke to the manager who i must admit is lovely and told her everything and she just said ' yeah this child is on a behavioural progamme and kids do jusy bite each other when they are teething or cant communicate...' I was kind of shocked by this and just said oh... ! I kept saying I wamted to fill out an accident form and they kept saying next time you come you can, but thay never happened, maybe because they didnt want it on record? Nothing like that happened again and other than that I was so pleased with the nursery I had never had any problems all the workers there loved my son and he loved them. Im just curious how would you of handled it. Deep down I wanted to find the kids parents and show them exactly what their child had done and I really wanted to scream and shout and demand something was done but im so unconfident I didnt know what to do.

Emm92zmx,"Today I got a call from the school to say my son has a head injury as another pupil had pushed him over so I went up the school only to be told this other child had actually kicked him Then threw him against the wall where he hit his head falling to the floor the other kid ran out with his other 2 friends leaving him Crying on the floor, the school told me to take him home for his own safety! 
I'm fuming and so upset, my son is very sensitive and has really been upset by this un provoked attack as he was having a wee by himself when they started. 

He is now scared to go to school although they have assured me they are investigating 
When I told his dad he was really angry and said to phone the police, I didn't even think of this I just thought the school would deal with it but the more I think about it the more I agree, my husbands friend died after a fight on his 30th birthday when a man punched him and he fell back and hit his head on the curb it was that that killed him so my husband was really worried and says the police should be involved 

The point of this post (sorry it's long) is what do you other mummies think I should do?? Or what would you do if it were your child?

Katherine C(83),"Hi everyone

I really hope you can help with this as i've never had to deal with something like this and i just feel so upset.

I have a 6 year old son who has just started year 2. He's the gentlest little boy you can meet, very polite, loves to talk to anyone and literally doesnt have a bad bone in his body. I think sometimes though this is his downfall as he just lets other kids push him around and still wants to play with the kids who are horrible to him.

So since nursery he's been in the same class as another little boy and i've become almost best friends with his mum. We walk to school together and have been through the last few years of our kids growing up together. She is lovely and we raise our kids the same way, we're the same age and just really get on. The thing is for the last year or so her little boy hasnt been very nice to mine and its got a lot worse this week.

I dont expect them to be friends just because i now am with his mum, and we all walk to school together BUT he seems to be controlling my boy a bit.

The things im worried about are: 

He told my son he can't play with any of their mates today because they were his mates not my sons, my son then sat on a bench at playtime because he didnt have anyone to play with. (he said all the people he wanted to play with were playing with this other boy)
At football practise the other boy said he didnt want my son on his team because he's rubbish at football (he also excluded him from another game at playtime because it was just for the kids that go to proper football training! Some parents have set up football training at weekends that i refuse to be bullied into taking him to as it cuts in to too much family time)
He bosses my son around and always tells him he's wrong about stuff when my son is right. On the walk to school the other boy ignores my son and tells him they cant play certain games etc.

So I know this is just part of growing up etc but my son is really upset and i feel sick at the thought of him sat on his own at playtime. I have told him to go and play with someone else, or just join in with the game the people he wants to play with are playing and to not let others boss him around. He says but there isnt anyone else to play with.

I feel like the other kid is a bit of a bully but only towards my son. I really want to say something to him but I know this may lead to a falling out with my friend his mum which I dont want as i like her so much. She thinks her son is amazing and would never do anything to upset anyone but its not true and i dont want to upset her. When we've had him over to play before he's been so naughty and very rude to us but i have never felt able to tell his parents that.

I know my son is no angel but if he was to behave like this i'd want to know about it.

I dont know whether to talk to his teacher, write a letter to the teacher or just leave it and let the kids sort it out between themselves......please help :(Hi everyoneI really hope you can help with this as i've never had to deal with something like this and i just feel so upset.I have a 6 year old son who has just started year 2.

Sara B(482),"I have a friend who lives very close by her son is three, same age as my daughter. 

On occasions they play nicely but I would say 70 per cent of the time he's pushing my daughter and he seems to do this when his mum isn't looking sometimes doesn't care and does it in front of us, he snatches things out of her hand, spits at her and tries to hold her. Both of their speech is quite good so my daughter always tells me what he's done or will tell him to stop but he fails to do so. 

As extreme as it sounds he reminds me of a bully and I never thought I would say i dislike a three year old child but I really can't stand him now!

They are going to the same nursery and I am so worried about my little girl where she is shy and more quiet he's loud and boisterous. I was even thinking about pulling my daughter out of nursery altogether or changing her hours to part time because of him but doesn't seem fair on her.

Not sure if I should have a word with his mum? We have another friend who lives close by with a son the same age and he was also picked on by this boy. It seems my friend either turns a blind eye or doesn't actually realise what her boy is like, even though her own family members have also mentioned his behaviour to her.

Han51ohy,"Hi,

I hope that someone can help with this. 

My daughter is no angel but she is not a problem child by any means. There have been a few instances of unkindness with a particular friend at school which I have been trying to deal with.

Today, there was another incident where my daughter apparently called the girl a name in a spat they had at break time. I found out from my daughter that the mother of the other child had confronted my daughter when she picked her child up from school before I'd arrived. The other parent called my daughter a &#034;nasty little brat&#034; out of earshot from the teacher.

It took a while for my daughter to tell me this and I found out too late to phone the school.

I'm furious that this mother has confronted my daughter in the yard in such a sly way! I would have appreciated her coming to me first and I would have given my daughter enough of a dressing down as i'm fed up of this behaviour carrying on now.

My daughter is no worried about going to school tomorrow and have to see this parent in the yard.

I want to speak to the class teacher about this but am not sure whether to go straight to the head?

Any advice would be much appreciated.Hi,I hope that someone can help with this. My daughter is no angel but she is not a problem child by any means.

Jac24wgj,"Hi all,

My fourteen year old daughter, who is one of the most caring and kind people I have ever known, is popular within her group of friends. However about six months or so ago a girl who used to be mean to her suddenly decided to befriend her. My daughter of course forgot the previous nastiness and welcomed her with open arms to her group of friends.

They have hung out together, sleepovers and within their group of friends. The problem started when my daughter started to &#034;date&#034; a boy in her year. My daughter and he were great friends before this development, and they still are. However, the previously mean girl has started talking to him on fb and has been saying all sorts of terrible things about my daughter, all of which is totally untrue! Luckily, he is annoyed with her and has told my daughter everything that has been said.

He's a sensible young man and has tried being diplomatic about it while trying to keep the friendships intact, but I am furious because this young lady doesn't think my daughter knows anything about the things she's saying, or that I know! To my daughter's face she is still calling her &#034;bestie&#034;. She has told my daughters &#034;boyfriend&#034; that she &#034;likes&#034; him and that she can't tell him to finish with my daughter because &#034;you love her for some reason&#034;. She then went on to say &#034;***** loves, loves, loves you and probably wants to go all the way, and I don't think you want that&#034; and has also said that she wants him to stop being all lovey dovey around her because she doesn't like it. Note here, lovey dovey between these two fourteen year olds is holding hands, nothing more, although he has kissed her on the top of her head :P 

My worry is, with school starting again very soon I am worried that she is not only saying things to my daughter's boyfriend, but possibly to others within their group of friends too and that others perhaps won't tell her what is being said about her. I want to stop this before it gets out of hand, but I'm not sure of the best way forward, so what would you do in this situation? More than anything I want to prevent my usually happy daughter from having to go back to school under a cloud. I have said I will leave it to them to sort out in their own way for now, but if it doesn't stop soon I will go and have a word with her parents (very scary), and perhaps show them the messages she has sent on fb.Hi all,My fourteen year old daughter, who is one of the most caring and kind people I have ever known, is popular within her group of friends.  However about six months or so ago a girl who used to be mean to her suddenly decided to befriend her.  My daughter of course forgot the previous nastiness and welcomed her with open arms to her group of friends.They have hung out together, sleepovers and within their group of friends.  The problem started when my daughter started to ""date"" a boy in her year.  My daughter and he were great friends before this development, and they still are.  However, the previously mean girl has started talking to him on fb and has been saying all sorts of terrible things about my daughter, all of which is totally untrue!  Luckily, he is annoyed with her and has told my daughter everything that has been said.He's a sensible young man and has tried being diplomatic about it while trying to keep the friendships intact, but I am furious because this young lady doesn't think my daughter knows anything about the things she's saying, or that I know!  To my daughter's face she is still calling her ""bestie"".  She has told my daughters ""boyfriend"" that she ""likes"" him and that she can't tell him to finish with my daughter because ""you love her for some reason"".  She then went on to say ""***** loves, loves, loves you and probably wants to go all the way, and I don't think you want that"" and has also said that she wants him to stop being all lovey dovey around her because she doesn't like it.  Note here, lovey dovey between these two fourteen year olds is holding hands, nothing more, although he has kissed her on the top of her head   My worry is, with school starting again very soon I am worried that she is not only saying things to my daughter's boyfriend, but possibly to others within their group of friends too and that others perhaps won't tell her what is being said about her.  I want to stop this before it gets out of hand, but I'm not sure of the best way forward, so what would you do in this situation?  More than anything I want to prevent my usually happy daughter from having to go back to school under a cloud.  I have said I will leave it to them to sort out in their own way for now, but if it doesn't stop soon I will go and have a word with her parents (very scary), and perhaps show them the messages she has sent on fb.",1,985, 23-08-2014 at 10.55AM

First time he has ever shown any sign off standing up for himself. { i know violence isn't the greatest way to deal with a situation , im guessing he had enough and snapped....He got detention so did the boy and i can understand that fighting isn't allowed in school. The school has special classes for kids who have behaviour problems and yet no support for kids who get bullied which makes me sick! Anyway the other day a boy starts giving my son grief he is younger than my boy and i don't believe in my boy hitting younger children so he told his sister to sort it out. My daughter done as her brother said and got herself in a fight with the boy same age as her she punched him, he punched her back grabbed her throw her on the floor and had his hands round her neck she also got bruised. Now as this was happening my son stood and did nothing because this boys cousin was there and said to my boy if you touch him i'll have you!

I was the same as a child but he didn't even say a word. I have had words with the other boys mum e.t.c. and i told my son what he had done was wrong. But what worries me the most is he won't even voice himself in the situation. He told me he was scared and i can fully understand. He could of come and got me' walked away' or told this kids mum but he froze. DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY ADVICE Sorry there's so much to read.

I was the same as a child but he didn't even say a word. I have had words with the other boys mum e.t.c. and i told my son what he had done was wrong. But what worries me the most is he won't even voice himself in the situation. He told me he was scared and i can fully understand. He could of come and got me' walked away' or told this kids mum but he froze. DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY ADVICE Sorry there's so much to read. Just so people know i have tried teaching him to be assertive told him that it's not right that people treat you that way. Nothig is working.",10,"1,202", 21-07-2014 at 2.00PM  
Emi97mvv,"Hi there, 

I am writing to find mums whose kids might be experiencing bullying as a result of learning a 'posh' accent or might have been in the past? This could be in the form of continuous teasing, verbal bullying or even physical violence.

How severe is the bullying and how do you/did you cope, as a mum does this worry you?

The article that was in the Independent has prompted me to post on this page. 

 Children bullied because of their wealthy backgrounds, study finds - Telegraph 

***************************************…

I ask because I am putting together a documentary on prejudice towards speakers of the 'Queen's English' and/or 'received pronunciation' in the style of BBC Three and I am looking for young people who are experiencing this issue or has done and is willing to talk about it with me. 

I have put out a survey to gage public opinion about this issue and so far the results have been really worrying but very interesting as I have asked people to give examples and it's become clear the prejudice exists. One person even said that when they were at a new school they were punched in the face from someone just overhearing his accent in a conversation. 

The survey is here if you have a spare moment to fill it out... https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/695DCS3 please get in touch.Hi there, I am writing to find mums whose kids might be experiencing bullying as a result of learning a 'posh' accent or might have been in the past?

Deleted profile,My 6 yr old DD has been having a lot of problems with another girl in her class who we have discussed many times with the teacher. My DD wants to be her friend but the stuff DD describes she does I would describe as psychological bullying. Examples include telling DD that things she has are rubbish and encouraging her to bin them. Anyway I have discuss their relationship with the teacher who says she sees things very differently to what DD is telling me. Anyway yesterday DD told DH that said child had made a joke about killing the teachers so they could do whatever they want. DH told DD that was wrong and not to go near this child. Anyway I have just collected DD from after school club and one of the staff said DD just told her that she had been made to promise this child she would bring a knife to school tomorrow so she can kill herself otherwise they will destroy her flower hair band.My 6 yr old DD has been having a lot of problems with another girl in her class who we have discussed many times with the teacher.

Rachel M(1142),"My son, although, quite normal to me. When he arrived at his primary school he was deemed not to be so. He didn't fit in where he should have done according to national statistics. I was required to take him to a speech and language therapist (although there was nothing wrong with his speech or language). There must have been something wrong with his understanding. (not the teacher's teaching). This rolled onto an educational psychologist (at my request). I thought I might help my son's teachers with their teaching skills, to a paediatrician and, finally, occupational therapy.


I found out, just the other day, through one of the other parents (who used to be a dinner lady) from j's school that for the majority of the time from feb.to oct. last year, at lunch time (a time which is surely meant to be sociable) J was made to sit on a table on his own for 15 mins until yr 6 children came in and sat with him for their lunch. Bearing in mind, he would have been 5 at the time; 6 at the end of the period. Of course, yr 6 children eat their lunch alot quicker that j, so he might well have been on his own at the end of that time. Unless, he was moved to a table with reception children. J was yr 1 at the time, going on to be Yr 2.




This was explained to me by the parent as j being bullied by the teachers. Although she later conceded that perhaps the headmistress didn't know what to do with J. You see the reason he was put in that position was down to his behaviour. He would spit and touch other children's food. Surely, in that case, in order to teach J proper social behaviour it was for a teacher to sit at the lunch table with j and his peers. Not isolate him. I am so angry about this. I approached the headmistress when I found out. She defended herself on the basis of J's behaviour. She thought he could learn proper behaviour from yr 6 children. I am still so angry about this. It changed, apparently, because I said something. Probably, on the basis of something that J said to me. But I couldn't know the extent of what was happening.

Cha55jwl,"Hi,

I know compared to a lot of posts my sons situation hasn't been going on for nearly as long but I'd like some advice to help him deal with it. He's a happy little fellow who at home is very confident and noisy but at school he can be quite shy and quiet, although his confidence is growing. His biggest problem is that when something bothers him he gets upset and either cries or lashes out with a bit of name calling. Because he cries he is now being picked on more and more. One boy in particular picks on him, but to the teachers this boy is &#034;just boisterous&#034;. This boy is encouraging other boys to &#034;not be his friend&#034; and call him names etc... Always so that &#034;he&#034; doesn't get told off. 

How can I &#034;teach&#034; my child to stay positive to help him deal with this. He's like any other child and just wants to be liked. He couldn't sleep tonight saying &#034;he's hates the world&#034;. He's my world and it's making me so very sad :-(.

New to this so here goes :)

My eldest daughter is 8. Her year at school is small class. Total of 8 girls (including her) and about 9 boys.

So anyway, they seem to have all split into groups. But there seems to be one leader of all the girls (call her T) Now T has started to tell my girl that she is not friends and not allowed to play with them and basically encourages the other girls to do the same. This is not only happening in school but out of school as well.

My daughter;s best friend moved away earlier this year but they see each other fortnightly. A new girl started around the same time and she and my daughter became very friendly. We all live local to each other But T lives opposite the new girl.

Well now even the new girl has turned against my daughter. She used to love school but now keeps crying, having nightmares, saying she is ill.

My heart breaks to think of her sitting one her own at lunch and playtimes. I was bullied as a child though and not sure if this makes me too emotional about this.

One day they are friends then T is horrible and they all turn against my daughter :(

Parents of T think she can do no wrong.

School say it is just girls being girls.

Is this right???

I am at the end of my tether and seriously considering moving away. We chose this school not only for being local but because it is smaller than the others in the area. Now I am not sure what to do?

It is bordering on bullying . My daughter is a beautiful human being inside and out and she knows she must really feel sorry for her and her mum but it is affecting her as she can`t understand why this is happening. It`s hard telling her it will all blow over and she is the better person and should rise above it when what I really want to do is to go and see this immature woman and tell her a few home truths!

Ang05mlg,"Hi everyone .. cut straight to it ..

My 5 year old daughter is best friends with another little girl in her class at school. They have been best friends for about 2 years and are always together !!! They are usually very cute together! The little girl is normally a lovely girl and her mum is also very pleasant. My problem is for the past few weeks I've been noticing a change in my daughter. She is coming home from school most days telling me things like ... 'she was pushing me. she was saying she wasn't going to be my friend if i play with so and so. she was pulling my glasses off and wouldnt stop. etc' She also whispers in other classmates ears &amp; my daughter thinks they are 'talking about her'. There was also an incident in their dance class where the teacher told me that they had been arguing, when i asked my daughter about it, she told me that she had been pulling her glasses off again. Recently she came over for a sleep over, I went into the bedroom to check on them and saw my daughter standing with her friend infront of her, she had her heel on my daughters foot and was intentionally trying to hurt her, my daughter asked her to stop because it was hurting, but no matter how many times she asked her to stop, she wouldnt move her foot! She was aware what she doing but still did it. I then obviously had to tell her to stop myself, she then moved her foot and ran away giggling. Things have been happening on separate occasions but its only recently that I have started to feel that my daughter might be being bullied by her best friend. I am aware that kids will have little tiffs and fall outs but I'm worried its starting to become an issue. I'm worried that it may just be little things just now, but if its not dealt with it may escalate into much more serious bullying? I am going to see my daughters teacher 2morro but I'm unsure about what I should say?

My daughter is a very confident, friendly and sociable little girl and I want her to stay that way, she feels that she isnt allowed to play with anyone else.

Any advice please Veryy worried mum !!Hi everyone [Sad] .. cut straight to it ..My 5 year old daughter is best friends with another little girl in her class at school. They have been best friends for about 2 years and are always together [Hug] !!! They are usually very cute together! The little girl is normally a lovely girl and her mum is also very pleasant. My problem is for the past few weeks I've been noticing a change in my daughter. She is coming home from school most days telling me things like ... 'she was pushing me. she was saying she wasn't going to be my friend if i play with so and so. she was pulling my glasses off and wouldnt stop. etc' She also whispers in other classmates ears & my daughter thinks they are 'talking about her'. There was also an incident in their dance class where the teacher told me that they had been arguing, when i asked my daughter about it, she told me that she had been pulling her glasses off again. Recently she came over for a sleep over, I went into the bedroom to check on them and saw my daughter standing with her friend infront of her, she had her heel on my daughters foot and was intentionally trying to hurt her, my daughter asked her to stop because it was hurting, but no matter how many times she asked her to stop, she wouldnt move her foot! She was aware what she doing but still did it. I then obviously had to tell her to stop myself, she then moved her foot and ran away giggling. Things have been happening on separate occasions but its only recently that I have started to feel that my daughter might be being bullied by her best friend. I am aware that kids will have little tiffs and fall outs but I'm worried its starting to become an issue. I'm worried that it may just be little things just now, but if its not dealt with it may escalate into much more serious bullying? I am going to see my daughters teacher 2morro but I'm unsure about what I should say?

Deleted profile,"Hi there,

I'm hoping that that some of you can help me with how I'm feeling right now and give me your honest opinion on this subject. 

My daughter has had a friend, I'll call her 'A' for about 4 years now and they are only 9, so that's the second year of Junior school. There were initially 3 classes, but they were all broken down into 2 classes and a young girl named 'C' has came into my daughter's class. She was quite happy as 'C' had been bullied last year, my daughter had stood up for her and they'd become quite good friends. So you can imaging how much she was looking forward to this year, she thought she was going to have 2 best friends. Fast forward a few moths and both 'A' and 'C' are the best of friends, ignoring my daughter, leaving her out etc. Yes I hear some of you say, this is normal and girls are quite (swearword here), so I tried to let my daughter get on with it, in the hope they'd be friends again soon. 
Three weeks went past and nothing changed and my daughter started becoming quite sad. I went in to the school to find out what's been going on, and the teacher said my daughter should try and play with other friends.
Well luckily my daughter is popular and gets on with a lot of the children in her year group and she did just this, but 'C' and 'A' decided they suddenly wanted to play with her new friends and began leaving her out.
I know I shouldn't care, but I don't think I'd be doing my job as a mother if I didn't try to help her and as I often speak to all my daughters friends and was hopeful at the time, their friendship could be saved. I gave my daughter a hug as she stood in the queue and saw 'C' and 'A', about 2 children in front of her. So as I was passing I said hiya and asked them was everything alright between them and my daughter, they said she was always trying to split them up. I thanked them for letting me know and decided to tell my daughter not too be too bossy and just play with her other friends, who 'C' and 'A' have now began taking away from her.
This is where I get to my point, there was a teacher in the yard that day, in fact I ended up talking to her as the children went in, and we had a joke, but 'C' went home that day and told her mother some sort of lie as she pretty much bawled me out the very next day and threatened me. When I suggested taking it into the school, she began accusing me of stating her daughter was a bully and I had confronted said child. When I pointed out that what she was doing to me was a confrontation, and I had done no such thing, she was excessively rude and nasty in the teachers office and far from attempting to subdue her and try to focus on our children, the teachers seemed to excuse her behaviour, I wont go into specifics.
I now feel very uncomfortable at the school, that I can no longer speak to my daughter's friends and I feel the teachers have become frosty towards me, 'C' who was bullied last year and was protected by my daughter is now attempting to stare her out, take her friends and knock her over. That's all my daughter will tell me, the school are pretending things will calm down, but they haven't for weeks and because 'C's mother was not castigated for her bad behaviour and the school are doing their upmost to pretend this didn't happen, 'C' is getting away with what could quickly become bullying.
Every parent talks to their children's friends at some point and I know I didn't do anything wrong, I would never do what 'C's mother claimed I have done, the hypocrisy of it all is that she ended up doing it to me and this makes me very angry.
I feel like I did something wrong, but I know in my heart 'C's mother and the school are more at fault for how this situation has escalated.

Liz47npx,"Hi,

This is my first ever post asking for advice so please excuse me if it's too long.

My DS is due to move to secondary school in September and today he has been offered a place at our first choice school. What should have been a happy day is tinged with worry as we have found out that 2 boys who have fairly systematically bullied him since year 2 have been allocated the same school (neither were meant to go there but due to them not getting their preferred schools and failing 11+, they will now be with my DS).

My DS is very sweet natured, gets on with a wide social circle outside of school (scouts, tennis, holiday clubs etc) and is quite confident. He is not a great sportsman (but always tries hard) and this seems to be the thing they pick on him most for. At school, he has been systematically taunted about his appearance, surname, physically kicked, never picked for teams excluded from games/playtimes etc, social exclusion, stealing his belongings..I could go on and on. My DS is frequently called a f****** loner, white n***er and a rapist. One of the bullies threatened to push him into a bonfire at scout camp over the weekend (nipped in the bud and dealt with by scout leader immediately). Neither boy has ever apologised to my DS. I know of 7 other sets of parents in DS' class who have been in about one of the boys over a 3 month period - there is a pack mentality and he is the ringleader, the other boy is more underhand. They pick on a range of children for different reasons - all I would class as a little vulnerable for one reason or another (wearing glasses, weight, skin colour etc). The ringleader talks about raping girls in their class, one of his main targets has now left the school at the end of yr 5 - this started when the bully was aged just 9 so I think there may be a child protection issue, in terms of what he is witnessing at home.

I have been in to see the HT twice last term when the racist name calling started but she didn't tell me what she was doing to address the situation, citing pupil confidentiality. She confirmed racist comments were going in the bullying log and the chair of governors and local education authority were made aware due to the racist nature, as per their bullying policy but nothing more. My DS has been allocated TA in KS1 to talk to if he's worried - he's never gone to her as yet as too embarrassed to and also he's in yr 6 so different breaktimes etc. Subsequently, one of the bullies has made homophobic comments to another boy and the HT informed that child's mother that letters have been sent home and the parents of the bullies called in. HT says the bullying will be logged on all pupil files and discussed at transition including my DS as the victim but I am concerned as to how much information will be passed onto the next school. I have spoken to bullying helplines etc and followed their advice - when I explained the type of thing going on the lady assumed it was 15/16year olds due to the sexualised language etc and said it was the worst case she had heard of in 10 years of working there. Btw, the school is rated Ofsted Outstanding (not that that means much anyway given what inspectors look at) but well overdue for inspection.

Should I approach the new school myself and speak to their pastoral team? I want my DS to have a fresh start in secondary school and I am concerned they will continue their taunting and bullying in a new school. At the same time, however I don't want my DS to be flagged as a potential problem either (I know he is the victim in this but I don't want to be seen as overprotective parent).

However a place came up at a lovely but very small school with under 10 in my daughters class she started last term and loved it made lots of friends and no problems at all. However near the end of term one of the parents started getting funny with me ignoring and giving out dirty looks, I think this has come from my daughter being friends with another little girl and (il call her child x) x has got very jealous of their friendship. Since this has started my daughter hasn't been invited to any parties as x has told other children not to invite my daughter, child x was waving party invites in my daighters face saying haha no one has invited you to their parties coz they don't likeyou. Iv had a word with the teacher and child x said sorry to my daughter but the dayafter things start again, its not too bad at the min but everyday more n more is happening.

But we are now left with the problem of him not feeling safe at school, which leads to practically every morning him crying and screaming when I drop him off. He just wants to stay with me. He has never been a clingy child, never had seperation anxiety as a toddler. There is no doubt in my mind that this is after effects of the bully. 
At the moment we have been entering school by reception which hasn't really helped, so tomorrow we are going in early before the other children arrive.
Just wondered of anyone else has been thro this and has any advice?

dan56nch,"Hi, I just wanted to seek some advice on what more I could do. I have a 5 year old son who is in reception, he didn't attend the schools nursery because he was in private nursery while I attended college and university. So when he started he was meeting everyone for the first time. It is a newly built large school and the reception class is 90 children, so it is split into 3 classes of 30, between 3 teachers. As soon as my son started school, he enjoyed it and made a lot of friends but everyday he kept coming home and telling me that someone was hitting him. I asked him who and if it was the same boy everyday and he said it was, and pointed him out to me. Being a responsible parent I didn't say anything to the child or the mother and instead told the teacher of his class, who admitted that she had not noticed. Everyday he same home with a different story that this boy had been hitting him, from elbowing him in the throat, biting his eye, kicking, punching, and on one occasion kicked him in the private parts. Everyday after the was happening I told the teacher who said she would talk to the boy and explained it was because my son was popular and this other boy had no friends and was jealous of him And there wasn't much that she could do. This was going on for months where it happened on a daily basis. One day I asked my son if he had been hurt that day and he said no, but that he had hurt this boy that had been bulling him, I asked him how and why, to which he pep lied that he was doing a stunt and the boy got in the way and he kicked him in the head by accident, he apologised, yet this boy still went to the teacher and my son got told off. This really upset him as it was an accident and he apologised. It annoys me that this boy has been hurting my child on a daily basis for months on end and nothing is done about it, yet my son who has never lashed out at anyone before gets punished for an accident? I don't know what to do anymore and it's getting to the point where he doesn't want to go to school on a morning, I just can't understand how a 5 year old knows how to bully someone for so long it makes him feel this way, and it scares me for the future as he will always be in his class, if he can do these things at 5 what will he be capable of when he's older? Any help will be appreciated, thank you and sorry for the essay.Hi, I just wanted to seek some advice on what more I could do. I have a 5 year old son who is in reception, he didn't attend the schools nursery because he was in private nursery while I attended college and university. So when he started he was meeting everyone for the first time. It is a newly built large school and the reception class is 90 children, so it is split into 3 classes of 30, between 3 teachers. As soon as my son started school, he enjoyed it and made a lot of friends but everyday he kept coming home and telling me that someone was hitting him. I asked him who and if it was the same boy everyday and he said it was, and pointed him out to me. Being a responsible parent I didn't say anything to the child or the mother and instead told the teacher of his class, who admitted that she had not noticed. Everyday he same home with a different story that this boy had been hitting him, from elbowing him in the throat, biting his eye, kicking, punching, and on one occasion kicked him in the private parts.

Sar67jzh,"Hi there,
I'm new to all this. I have read some of the posts on this subject and just want people to know that I think bullies are awful!. My Son is going to have an ADHD test as they say his concentration is poor and he fidgets constantly. My main concern is his temper, he just sees red in an instant, it is heartbreaking to see as I want my lovely boy back. The teachers and I are trying to get him away from a particular group of lads in his class who they say are bullying him, especially one (this is sad as he has been his best friend since reception, he is now in year two). They say, go and push that boy, or he called you an idiot to get him riled up and if that doesn't work then they slap him round the face to get him angry. It finally worked with the new boy who is timid and lovely. He left his old school because of bullying then in the space of two weeks my Son had him on the floor and was kicking him!. The school dealt with it very well, unfortunately I didn't as I embarrassed myself and broke down completely in front of the Mother for ages so she was consoling me!!. I made him write him a letter of apology and I wrote one to the Mum as I was devastated!. It's not about me and I know that, I'm just at a loss as to what to do about him, he is so angry, horrid to his little sister and it's getting to the point where I don't want to take him anywhere. He is an angel around my parents and can be wonderful, he always knows when he has done wrong and I an trying my best to nip it in the bud. I am lucky that he has great teachers who genuinely care and I have implemented reward charts, omega 3 oils and cut out all and I mean ALL the rubbish in his diet. I just hope it works. My Brother was severely bullied at school for 15 years and I see the damage it can do. Unfortunately my Sons Dad is a bully so he gets it from him, it's a constant battle at home but he must conform and always be kind. I'm rattling on now, but I just want people to know that some parents always take things like bullying very seriously and I will use every bit of my being to get him back to being the lovely boy he was a little while ago.

Geo13mky,"I was at my mother's house trying to find some things for my mat leave and I came across a notebook I had written in when I was about 15, there were lots of notes saying how I felt I was such a sad and ugly girl.

My thoughts immediately turned to when I was that age and how miserable I felt most of the time. I literally had no one to speak to at school, I was painfully shy, no one wanted to work with me or sit with me at lunch time and I was constantly told how I was ugly and clumsy (still am, terrible at sport) and so on. I changed schools 3 times and they were all just as bad.

When I went to university I started to forget about most of this and got on with my life as best as possible but it doesn't take much for me to lose confidence again, especially in big groups of strangers. I also muck up words easily and often lose my bottle and don't know what to say to people.

Obviously I'm super excited about being a mum as I was told when I was 18 I would never be able to have children. But I was talking to a friend today and she asked me what I would do if my child was bullied as well. It didn't immediately cross my mind as I have 5 years to go before I even worry about school for my baby. But I suddenly got concerned that maybe I would subconsciously transmit my experiences to my child? I don't want my baby to go through the same pain that I did. But I guess it's not automatic, because my mother was never bullied and my father was probably the most confident man I've ever come across. Everyone else in my family (not that they speak to me much) is super confident, my younger cousins were both head girl material and prom queens and the others did a lot of drama and theatre work. 

I hope there is someone who had a similar experience and their child was totally fine!I was at my mother's house trying to find some things for my mat leave and I came across a notebook I had written in when I was about 15, there were lots of notes saying how I felt I was such a sad and ugly girl.My thoughts immediately turned to when I was that age and how miserable I felt most of the time.

Sha92hkb,"Dear all,

Please can you let me know of this situation? I am being stared at and gossiped about at my children's school. It all started when my nursery aged son was invited to a party and I had to also take his older sister, who is 7, with me.

About 5 minutes into the party, my son told me that some girls were being nasty to his sister. So I went to have a look, expecting the usual spat that happens in indoor play centres.

What I found shocked me! I saw my daughter having her hair and clothes pulled and being scratched by two 3-4 year old girls. My daughter was just standing there in shock, not reacting, whilst these two young girls were attacking her.

As this was happening inside some netting and the place was loud, I immediately shouted at the two girls to stop. I was completely shocked by what I'd seen and I wanted it to stop straight away.

I called the two girls out and I told them we were going to look for their mums straight away. I found one mum and I said to her that I'd just found her daughter attacking my daughter. I was very upset, but the mother said I was being harsh. I said I wasn't, especially as my daughters neck was visibly scratched front and back. Then one of her friends piped up to stick up for her so I ended up walking away. I was shaking and furious, to be told I was basically over-reacting. After that scene, I did not speak to the mother of the other girl, as the atmosphere was bad already!

The girl then did apologise, which I did appreciate.

Now, at the school, when is pick up my son, the mother of the child I did not confront, has started to stare me out. I see her talking to other mums and then looking at me. When I walk past her and her friends, they go quiet and all stare at me. It is all very childish. Even some of the other mums have stopped speaking to me, which I think is cowardly.

She did it to me again today, so when I got to my car, I drove around the area trying to find her, so I could basically tell her that I don't appreciate dirty looks and gossip, and we are better off talking about the situation rather then playing childish games. 

Can any one give me any advice on what to do? 

I would appreciate some feed back,

 I'm new to the forum and would really appreciate your perspectives I really don't know if I'm over reacting to a situation which has arisen at my daughters school, I'm sure you will all appreciate as a Mum it's sometimes difficult to see things clearly when your child is upset.

 My daughter is 12 years old and an S1 pupil at secondary school. On more than one occasion she has come home upset by comments made by a male teacher, he shouted at her to &#034;calm her hormones&#034; in front of her entire class, she found this totally humiliating. Since then he has called her a reprobate, when she asked him what it meant his response was &#034;that's why I called you it&#034;, &#034;lets just say it means dodgy&#034;, he's called her this on more than one occasion. 

 I'm not sure if it was a throw away comment or if his intent was to embarrass her by using a word he knew she wouldn't understand and I doubt he will admit to it even if it was! I'm due to go into the school to speak to the head of her year and I'm really not sure what to do next.

Breena,"Hello!

My son started school in Sept and quickly made friends with a lil boy that keeps hitting him in class and in the playground. His teacher said she was monitoring the situation a few months ago when I made a complaint to her that my son kept coming home reporting incidents to us. 

They separated the boys so they did not interact in class, but this has not done much good as over the past week the other boy has hit my son on the head with a plastic tray, in class, and pushed him over in the playground. The last straw was when he pulled my sons trouser and pants down and slapped his bottom, in the playground! He and the other kids laughed at his prank. The other boy is 4 or 5 yo.

I then arranged to see the head of reception who assured me this behavior would not be tolerated and other kid would be closely monitored and his parents had been informed. The following day he pushed my son over abruptly. Also the teacher and senior members of staff had no idea this incident involving his pants had happened, only the dinner ladies were aware and didnt tell anyone else. My son is happy but often doesn't want to go school saying his friend is not nice. 

I'd had enough so went to see the principle but all she offered was to be reactive and continue to monitor, in the meantime my son is still exposed to more violence! Where is the support for my son? His father and I are furious the principle sees no reason to support our child and offer to move him to another class at the very least. We called the school to arrange to meet her again until then our son is where he is safe,at home. 

She hasn't called us back - what should we do? He can't go back until this is sorted. Should we call Local Ed. Auth and let them know why he is not at school?

The principle thinks its a clash of personalities i disagree this child is hitting my child and humiliating him thats bullying!Hello!My son started school in Sept and quickly made friends with a lil boy that keeps hitting him in class and in the playground.

Reb03tob,"Hi, I am feeling really cross writing this but my dear daughter was punched at school today by another girl in reception. She has a nice mark on her arm and is obviously upset by what happened.

Her teacher came out and spoke to me about it before the end of school and apparently they had a talk after about how to treat each other but shouldnt more have been done? Abbie was only walking past the little bit** and got punched for no reason. :evil: 

I would have thought at least a note would have been sent to her parents to inform them of what a litte turd their daughter has been? Am i just being to over protective or should more have been done?

Abbie is a such a lovely girl and wouldnt hurt a fly. Am thinking about taking her to self defense classes so she can go kick some ass!! :lol: 

Help!!!

Faye M(3),"The thread from two years ago http://www.netmums.com/coffeehouse/children-parenting-190/bullying-42/450441-issues-dd2-need-advice-what-do.html 

Lately things have turned again no idea why.The girls are 8 years old year 4.

This little girl has been making my dd2's life hell again. Not so much physical bullying now she's turned to mental bullying. She tells my dd2 she is ugly and her whole family thinks she's ugly too. Her hair looks silly and her hairbands/clips are stupid. Dd2 is fat, She's not she's underweight and under the hospital care. Dd2 should not eat her lunch as it will make her fatter and even more ugly. 
If dd2 does not play with her she goes crying to a teacher and then gets dd2 in trouble for not playing nicely. This happens even if lg is playing with someone else she does not like my dd2 playing with anyone but her. She pushes her out of line so dd2 gets told off for mucking about. My dd2 drew a picture for us which even her teacher said was lovely. This little girl then cut up dd2's picture because it was stupid and babyish. Then tried to blame it on my older ds. 
On friday night dd2 woke up screaming. The little girl had told her that myself and dh were going to die (both her parents have passed away when she was a baby and she lives with grandparents). My dd2 was understandably very upset. 

I have tried until i blue in the face to speak to school about this. The school mum who used to help was a governor but has given it up due to another issue with a girl in our girls class who gets away with everything. 
The school seems to have no control over her. Her grandparents even less. She seems to love putting others down and getting them into trouble. I am just stuck and never taken seriously anymore. It all just gets brushed under the carpet. 

Any advise i would be greatful.

But then my daughter started to cry when leaving her at school and then i found out this child was pushing her and slapping her so went to speak to the teacher again and she blamed it on my daughter saying &#034;the other child in question is very confident it's her personality&#034; and she would keep an eye on it...so anyways my daughter seemed happy and i forgot about it..until after Christmas the teacher told me the same child had bitten my daughter!! and when i asked my daughter about it she said this child bites and kicks her on a daily basic-my daughter most days comes home with a accident form,(when shes at home with me she dose not really fall over that much) but when i asked the teacher she just said they are &#034;monitoring the situation&#034;

jackie w(146),"My dd age 11 started at secondary school in September it's an all girls school which did worry me a bit but she really wanted to go there and it gets very good results.
Anyway she started off really well and made friends with a girl who was actually in her junior school but they never crossed paths there.
this friendship was a bit intense to say the least which got me a bit worried and a few weeks ago dd came home really upset and said this girl had started to put her down in front of the others and kept telling her to go away, then next day be all over her again, I advised her to steer clear after this happened a few times and make more effort with the other girls who she gets on with.

Well on Monday dd was off sick and this girl started an argument with dd on Instagram (which everyone can read) dd gave it back a bit to which I got cross and told her to apologise and the other girl said sorry too.
Well for rest of the week the girl has blanked her and tried to take others away from her.
I met dd after school yesterday in town to do some Xmas shopping and as soon as she saw me she broke down in floods of tears saying she went to get her coat out of her locker and one of the other girls who has become pally with ex friend was standing in front of it and wouldn't move, dd asked her to move twice and she wouldn't so dd got angry and pushed her out the way, then ex friend appeared and told this girl to punch my daughter.

My daughter got her stuff and fled but they were shouting horrible stuff at her as she walked away, I'm glad she stood up to the other girl but she is so upset about all of this and dreading Monday, do you think I should tell head of year or form tutor or hope it will all blow over? She has blocked both of them on Instagram now.
This ex friend is constantly swearing on Instagram and saying she hates her family and she self harms (at 11!) she is also home alone every night after school until 7.30 until her mother gets home from work, I really felt sorry for her at first and had her at my home a lot, she obviously has issues but that's not an excuse to bully my daughter is it.

Deleted profile,"looking for some advice on situation and what to do next.

daughter started school in september apart from some lack of communication from school all was well, daughter was excited and eager and settling in well.

a couple of weeks later daughter comes home with bruise on back of legs at top of each thigh and one at side of one thigh. said girl A kicked her. 
had a chat with daughter and explained if shes upset or if anyone hurts her go and tell teacher, daughter agreed.
two days later teacher has chat with me when collecting daughter , daughter had been knocked over and teacher says how she praised daughter for coming and telling her, I explained chat with daughter about kicking and bruises, teacher says will keep an eye on this.

6 days later collect daughter seemed quieter than usual , come home have dinner and do homework, daughter has bath and I find 2 more fresh bruises, I ask daughter if she had hurt herself and how she got these, Daughter says girl B hurt back with chair and girl C poked her between legs (never had a bruise there in her life) I ask if she told her teacher she said yes I told miss * and she took me to room and had a peek to check I was ok.
next day I speak to member of staff at the school who knows my daughter she cant understand why daughter would lie as she knows daughter high functioning and not one to make things up .explains that if anything parent would be called in to check not teacher check and they discuss my concerns with headteacher, headteacher will phone me back that day. 
I end up calling headteacher as it was getting late in the day, headteacher explains that teacher unaware and that teacher would not have checked her and is any possibility of it having happened at home I say no and explain that the bruise had happened during school time as no bruise before school doesnt seem concerned.

explain im not happy sending daughter in, headteacher says understandable.

education welfare officer comes to see me and discuss. understands my concern and asks if im happy with how school have dealt with the problem
I say no as headteacher couldnt understand my concern and was quick to dismiss that it had happened during school time but dont know what else school could do.priority to get daughter back into school but need to ensure she is safe..says will set up meeting with headteacher to discuss and get headteacher to call me.

headteacher doesnt call . few days later try to contact headteacher not available leave message. 
headteacher still not contact. 

the next week talk to health visitor about my concerns she advised to vote with my feet so to speak.
the next week get form fill it in, put in reasons that not happy with daughter coming home with bruises which hadnt happened at other nurserys and daughter not happy there.
 dp takes it to headteacher to sign , headteacher keeps and says will send it through internal post to education department as quicker. 

get posted form back with headteacher comments saying no evidence happened in school and that due to poor attendance hadnt had chance to make friends. ( bearing in mind before this happened daughter was in school and no attendance problem )

also a letter saying that was going to send it to education department but realised it has to be Childs parent who hands form so sent it back to us.

rebecca b(623),"My DS is almost 6, he's a quiet boy and has some understanding difficulties (currently awating a speach therapist imput) he also has been seeing a child development doctor querying autism and adhd although after 2 years we are still no wiser.
 he's usually pleasant especially in school he gets along with one boy in particular and will play with others. Teacher said he's fine in class but can get giddy sometimes.
Well this morning DH took him to school and his teacher said that last Thursday and Friday DS was playing rough with 3 other children. DH said this is all she said when he rang me at work. Then when I got in DH said DS had been in trouble because he hit another boy causing his cheek to be scratched. 
I was so upset angry I cried I didn't know how to approach this DH appeared to have just told him off but I felt it wasn't enough. 
I explained how horrible it is and how upset the boy will feel. I also told him that if you hit people you will get into trouble with the police. However the police part scared him made him cry. So now I'm thinking have I approached this right what do I do or say? 
I said tomorrow he will say sorry to the boy and to the teacher but I don't know if he understands the seriousness of what he's done? 
He's never done this before or hot anyone out of spite? 
What do I do?My DS is almost 6, he's a quiet boy and has some understanding difficulties (currently awating a speach therapist imput) he also has been seeing a child development doctor querying autism and adhd although after 2 years we are still no wiser. he's usually pleasant especially in school he gets along with one boy in particular and will play with others. Teacher said he's fine in class but can get giddy sometimes.Well this morning DH took him to school and his teacher said that last Thursday and Friday DS was playing rough with 3 other children. DH said this is all she said when he rang me at work. Then when I got in DH said DS had been in trouble because he hit another boy causing his cheek to be scratched. I was so upset angry I cried I didn't know how to approach this DH appeared to have just told him off but I felt it wasn't enough. I explained how horrible it is and how upset the boy will feel.

Hel09cax,"Hi

Should I be doing more or leave it to the Teacher.

My Eldest dd who is 8 has had a rough year with long term Headaches which has knocked her self-esteem. On top of that the last 2 school years she has been taken away from her friends (year split between 2 classes) &amp; is not only in a class of mainly boys (21 boys &amp; 9 girls) but is sat on a table with her &amp; 5 boys. One of the few girls in her class is the class bully (hardly a week goes by that her mum not called in).

Well a couple of the boys on her table are daily making comments to her such as 'You're such a weirdo' (when has a headache), 'Swot' &amp; 'know it all' (when gets something right), 'Fatty' (she has gained weight with medicines she on). Also the girl in her class has been being nasty with comments too. So she is getting it from all angles &amp; due to having quite a few wet playtimes hasn't even had the respite of going outside to talk to her friends in other classes.

I did speak to her teacher &amp; at first she totally denied it was going on but after a few days did admit there was a bit of name calling but feels my dd is being oversensitive as they were not really meant in the way my dd takes them. Now I do know due to her low self-esteem dd is a bit over sensitive at the moment but surely it should be stopped which it not. Also the Teacher did say that she has noticed dd no longer puts her hand up in class to answer questions &amp; seems to lack concentration now.
 
Also this morning I have noticed dd has patches of red sore skin on her arms when I asked her she says her arms itch but only when at school. So I'm worried the stress is getting to her. We have already discussed the possibility with her Neurologist that Stress or the illness &amp; at school is making her headaches worse &amp; tried to get her someone to assess this.

Deleted profile,"I am posting as anon, incase the other parent concerned is reading and recognises this!

My dd (4 in may) started reception in September. As we were from out of area she had no friends from her nursery at this school. We did however make friends with a girl and her mum on the settling in visit. We met them a few times over the summer to allow the girls to get to know each other before their start date in September.

So, all well and good.

More recently, my dd has come home from school very upset that the other child won't allow her to play with the other kids and insists she play only with her and doing only what she wants to do. My friend is aware of how strong willed her daughter can be and says she did have problems mixing in nursery as she insisted on playing 'her' game and no one else's. Her mum was hoping this would resolve itself as it severely hampered her friendships.

I realise I have only my dd version of what is going on btw. She has mentioned that the other girl holds her by her arm and drags her to keep her in place! There is also much tit for tat about who will and won't be going to birthday parties should she not do as her friend says. I feel my dd is too easily influenced so am trying to get her to stand her ground a bit.

Should I ask the teacher to separate them a bit? to allow them both space to create new friendships or leave them to battle it out. My concern would be that my dd would become more introverted to her friend who us very domineering. I encourage my dd to make different friends each day but obviously with the domineering way her friend can be, it is difficult for her to break away.

I have not spoken to my friend about her daughters behaviour as yet as they are both lovely people and I wouldn't want to loose their friendship.

Sam73nwi,"I've been concerned about my son for a few months now. He has been tired, irritable and quiet. His school work has been fine and we have ruled out any medical issues. Today he came home from school in a fairly good mood. Because it is quite unusual for this to happen I mentioned to him that it sounded like he had had a good day. And a very sad, upsetting story emerged...

He says that most of the time he hates school. There is a boy in his class (he's in year 4) that generally makes everyone's life a misery. He lies, sets people up to get them in trouble and is horrible about their work. It seems that a lot of this is directed towards my son. Apparently this boy won't let him play football with everyone at lunchtime and will go out of his way to entice the children my son is playing with, away. He deliberately blocks my sons way on the stairs and makes comments about his work and appearance. He laughs at him and says mean things, although my son wouldn't/didn't say exactly what (he was very upset by this point and could hardly talk anyway for the tears). My son says he feels lonely and sad and that all he wants to do is cry but he is afraid to because of what this other boy might do or say. He says it is more than making fun of him but he doesn't see any point in telling the teachers as they never believe anyone. He admitted that last week he had lied about feeling ill just so that he didn't have to go to school. 

He doesn't want me to go in and see the teacher as he thinks this will make it worse. I'm not inclined to at the moment as I don't want him anymore upset than he already is. But I wondered if anyone has any advice for what I can do to support my son over the next few weeks while I monitor what is going on. I don't want to constantly question him about school as I think he might clam up but obviously I need to find out what incidents might be happening. There has been no physical violence but from the state he was in the mental effects run quite deep already. Any advice would be greatly received.

Sal67goi,"My child is in a horrid situation at school where she is increasingly being left out and isolated. Nothing physical - but lots of whispering, silly games like trying to steal things from her bag, backs turned on her etc...

I am speaking to the school this week and hope they will help and support her.

I was wanting some advice on the best way for me to help her help herself. I can't be there to fight her battles in the playground and in the class and want advice on what to teach her to do in response to any of this emotional bullying. 

There is a big group of girls and they can be pretty intimidating even to walk past on our way into school as it feels 'us' against 'them'.

I have always told her that if you are nice to others then you can always hold your head up high. It's hard when this doesn't pay off though. 

I am trying to make sure I am there to talk to each day and am giving her plenty of cuddles and time and planning fun times when we play together, chat together ...but it is eating away at her self esteem.

Part of me wants to ask if she can move classes - but I don't know if this would be teaching her that it is easy to run way from the problem and that we should find a way to 'mend' it instead.

You see she already shows signs of being different to other children as well as she wears glasses, she is very tall so big for her age so sticks out like a sore thumb already.

Her dad was bullied through school for being tall and I always had trouble trying to fit in to the point were I had to become a different person just so I had friends which didn't really work. I was always the one to get picked out by people. Only now do I feel comfortable being who I am and I just dont want the same for her.

I also wonder if its our decisions now that may affect her in the future. She listens to what music we do which tends to be old hits not the kind of music that is currently trending. Little things like this I worry will give her a unique personality and will cause her to get bullied. If there is anything you can suggest I would greatly appreciate it or even if you just tell me to stop being silly I will appreciate that too!Hi, my daughter is only 15 months old and its probably a bit early to be worrying about bullying but I would like to know if there's anything I can do now to try prevent it or better prepare her for it when shes older.You see she already shows signs of being different to other children as well as she wears glasses, she is very tall so big for her age so sticks out like a sore thumb already.Her dad was bullied through school for being tall and I always had trouble trying to fit in to the point were I had to become a different person just so I had friends which didn't really work.

My daughter is 10 and is a real individual, she listens to older music like Queen and doesn't dress in all the designer names other kids do here, prefers to have her own style and isn't interested in the same things as the other lasses in her class. My kids go to a small village school though where there is no uniform and there are a couple of nasty girls in her class who started picking on her. It was happening a bit before the summer but since then it has got a lot worse. 

She wants to be friends and I have seen her say a cheery hi to them when she goes into the playground and them rolling their eyes, mocking her and then running away laughing, it just breaks my heart :(
 They taunt her because she doesn't wear the right clothes, she doesn't listen to the same music and she thinks they are all a bit childish. To start with I tried to help her find common ground and invite them over but it has gone too far now. 
She goes up to a bigger school after the summer and I know there will be lots of other kids there who might have more in common with her but that feels a long way away right now -any tips for making the next 6 months more bearable?

Emm00wuf,"Hey there, I wonder if anyone has any advice for me?
I have a 14 year old son who is a sensitive soul. He is a quiet boy who likes to read and spends a lot of time on his computer. He has friends from his old primary school he kept in touch with but he got into a different secondary school which we thought was a good one. It very quickly turned out to be unsuitable though, he didn't seem to be learning much and was being picked on by a group of bad kids in his class. I made the decision to move him to one just a little bit further way after Christmas of the first year. 
Since he has been in this secondary school since and although there were a few teething problems it seemed ok. There were bad kids here too but he was able to keep out of their way and keep his head down. It probably didn't help that he didn't start with others but he befriended a classmate after a while and they were fine. This friend moved house and went to a different school before the summer though and since then things have gone downhill. A group of boys (and a few girls) seem to go out of their way to make his lessons difficult - taunting him for having longer hair, taking his stuff and then teasing him for being a tell tale. This is really starting to wear him down and he has asked to not go to school a few days when he knows he has lessons with the worst ones.
It has crossed my mind that maybe we should move him again but part of me is worried that it might happen again.

Deb26isu,"My daughter joined a new class at school with her friend. 

Over time their friendship broke down and the friend made her way to find new friends in the class. My daughter was left on the sidelines feeling a bit lost.

Over time my daughter is now faced with daily occurrences of being left out, being ignored and pushed out, people whispering behind her back and just making her feel unwanted and uncomfortable. 

There is no physical bullying or threats but even walking into the playground in the morning is horrid. We have tried smiling and saying hello and they all turn away and whisper and move away. She has to face this kind of behaviour through the day each day every day and is becoming increasingly isolated and unhappy. It's very subtle but is so so hurtful. 

To her credit she has held her head high and made other friends in the other class but still has to endure a constant stream of being left out and whispered about day after day and it is whittling away at her self esteem and confidence.

I want to intervene and help her but there is no physical evidence of bullying - it is all 'emotional'.

Do you think it is right to say something and step in as a mum?

Han10jxd,"My daughter is part of a groups of friends and some of them are mean to one girl in the class.

She (I really hope) hasn't been mean to this girl directly but as a group they leave her out and whisper about her and I don't want my child to be part of a group that is making another child feel unhappy.

There are lots of nice friends within the group but en masse they can be quite dominating and I think there can be peer pressure to join in, stick with the group and be part of what they are doing. 

I don't want to take her away from her friends but want to make sure she knows that it is wrong to follow any peer pressure in a group that might make others unhappy.

Any advice on how I talk to her about this and what I should do to help? Perhaps it is not even my place to get involved?My daughter is part of a groups of friends and some of them are mean to one girl in the class.She (I really hope) hasn't been mean to this girl directly but as a group they leave her out and whisper about her and I don't want my child to be part of a group that is making another child feel unhappy.There are lots of nice friends within the group but en masse they can be quite dominating and I think there can be peer pressure to join in, stick with the group and be part of what they are doing.

Deleted profile,"Hi All,

My Daughter is 10 and since being back at school after the summer holidays she has been like a different child...aggressive, not going to bed when asked, not wanting to go to school in the mornings and complaining about her new teacher. The complaints have been minor but she has felt the teacher picks on her.
I have basically ignored it because my Daughter can be extremely sensitive so I assumed that was all it was. That was until she came home from school and told me the teacher had hit her over the head with rolled up paper because she had made a mistake by putting the wrong size paper in the printer. I assumed this was done in jest and asked her did she feel the teacher was being playful... She replied &#034;No Mum, it hurt&#034; It happened in front of the whole class and one of My Daughters friends has corroborated her story.

I questioned her a little more and discovered that at the beginning of term another pupil lost his pen. The teacher addressed the whole class and asked &#034;Whoever stole the pen please stand up!&#034; No-one stood up Then she said &#034;Hadnt you better Stand up....(My daughters name)?&#034; My Daughter replied &#034;But Miss Ive done nothing wrong&#034; The teacher said &#034;You know what you have done!&#034; It turned out The pupil had not even lost his pen!

First thing I did was ring the school and complain to the office. I waited all day expecting the Head teacher to phone me...But no call came. I then began to feel we were being ignored because even if she was busy that day she should have asked her assistant to call me over something so serious.

The next morning I emailed The Head a letter of complaint and I also hand delivered a copy of the letter to The school office requesting an immediate meeting. The Head rang me and arranged a meeting. During The meeting I got the distinct impression that they did not believe my Daughters story. The Teachers assistant who was present even rolled her eyes a few times!
The Head told me Me that My Daughter's behaviour at school since the begining of term had become a cause for concern...I quickly asked &#034;So Why have I not been informed of this?&#034; They said this is something they will look into...The Head later emailed me and and retracted her statement by saying My Daughters behaviour had actually really improved of late. :/ Now I'm confused!

My Gut instinct tells me they are going to try and wriggle out of this.
They are interviewing My Daughters friend who witnessed to bash on the head with the paper on Monday morning so hopefully that will be enough proof.

But will it? What should happen once My Daughters friend corroborates her story?

My Daughter looks as though a huge weight has been lifted off her shoulders since she told me about her teacher bullying her and I just do not want this teacher getting away with it!

Has anyone else experienced similar?Hi All,My Daughter is 10 and since being back at school after the summer holidays she has been like a different child...aggressive, not going to bed when asked, not wanting to go to school in the mornings and complaining about her new teacher.

Charli B(7),"Since my step daughter moved in with us in march due to being removed from her mother and then her grandparents she has settled into our family with her sister who is 4, she in now 7...
But since starting a new school she has had trouble settling in the school is small consisting of 250 kids...
Yesterday she came home after punching a girl in the chest after not getting the attention she wanted by the girl or her friends..we know she has problems with relating to other kids and is jelouse of others mainly the attention they are getting etc... because she has bullied other kids younger and older in her previous school and nothing has been done she thinks it's alright to do!
Anyway
Yesterday we threatened to take her to the girls house so she could punch her then take her to the police, anyway her head teacher told us it was the wrong thing to do we don't see it that way though we see it as she needs to learn what that other child thought as she was smacked etc...
Are we wrong?
Anyone been through this?

far45biw,"Need some help, advice and sympathy if you have some 'Netmummy's'.

I don't even know if I am blowing this out of proportion as other people's story around bullying seem to be far worse and I do feel sorry for them.:hug:
 
My DD since recpetion has always had everyone as her friend and we've always brought her up to understand that everyone should be your friend and to play with everyone. However, in Year 1 the classes were split up and my DD was grouped with 2 girls whose only friend was my DD which at the time was very unfair and we did mention this and then had to see what happened in Year 1. Well Year 1 came and we had all the issues of these 2 girls controling my DD and telling her she couldn't play with other children. Other children came up to play and were told by these 2 girls that they weren't allowed to play with my DD and would then have to walk away. We mentioned it to the Year 1 teacher and at the end of Year 1 we were getting somehwere with my DD playing with other girls. Now in Year 2 and apart from having a teacher who doesnt seem to be too bothered as we've already had 2 run in's with her and she's managed to tell my DD off and make her cry in class to the point that my DD was too scare to go back to school (considering previous teachers have actually come up to me to say how sensible and a delight my DD is to have in the class, so the only reason the teacher talks to my DD in this tone is because we have had to air our opinion which she didnt like), it's happening again. The teacher initially had them paired up which baffled me as the notes should have followed from Y1, but then when we mentioned the situation so she separated my DD but said she couldnt control what happens in the playground. Now my DD comes home crying as the girls are doing this control thing again. I have other mothers coming up to me telling me what has happened and that thier DD has had to walk away and that my DD has been upset...so it's just not my observation now....what do I do...my DD is a quiet, sensible little thing who doesn't want to get anyone else into trouble and won't speak up...I feel I need to build her confidence, but how ( she was also bullied in Nursery physically with girls holding a hula hoop around her neck when teachers wern't looking, can you believe that!)..so I do know it's a confidence thing...but am I blowing this out of proportion to go to the head of the school to get this resolved now...any advice please....her teacher's comments were that they'll probably grow up and be best friends, didnt give me any confidence that she was taking this seriously seeing as my duaghter is crying every week because of it!Need some help, advice and sympathy if you have some 'Netmummy's'.I don't even know if I am blowing this out of proportion as other people's story around bullying seem to be far worse and I do feel sorry for them.:hug: My DD since recpetion has always had everyone as her friend and we've always brought her up to understand that everyone should be your friend and to play with everyone.  However, in Year 1 the classes were split up and my DD was grouped with 2 girls whose only friend was my DD which at the time was very unfair and we did mention this and then had to see what happened in Year 1.  Well Year 1 came and we had all the issues of these 2 girls controling my DD and telling her she couldn't play with other children.  Other children came up to play and were told by these 2 girls that they weren't allowed to play with my DD and would then have to walk away.  We mentioned it to the Year 1 teacher and at the end of Year 1 we were getting somehwere with my DD playing with other girls.  Now in Year 2 and apart from having a teacher who doesnt seem to be too bothered as we've already had 2 run in's with her and she's managed to tell my DD off and make her cry in class to the point that my DD was too scare to go back to school (considering previous teachers have actually come up to me to say how sensible and a delight my DD is to have in the class, so the only reason the teacher talks to my DD in this tone is because we have had to air our opinion which she didnt like), it's happening again.  The teacher initially had them paired up which baffled me as the notes should have followed from Y1, but then when we mentioned the situation so she separated my DD but said she couldnt control what happens in the playground.  Now my DD comes home crying as the girls are doing this control thing again.  I have other mothers coming up to me telling me what has happened and that thier DD has had to walk away and that my DD has been upset...so it's just not my observation now....what do I do...my DD is a quiet, sensible little thing who doesn't want to get anyone else into trouble and won't speak up...I feel I need to build her confidence, but how ( she was also bullied in Nursery physically with girls holding a hula hoop around her neck when teachers wern't looking, can you believe that!)..so I do know it's a confidence thing...but am I blowing this out of proportion to go to the head of the school to get this resolved now...any advice please....her teacher's comments were that they'll probably grow up and be best friends, didnt give me any confidence that she was taking this seriously seeing as my duaghter is crying every week because of it!",4,"1,184", 25-10-2013 at 10.00AM  
Michaela W(15),"Not long got back from a party of one of DS's school friends. (He's 5 nearly 6). A lot of the boys were playing rough and play fighting and I was conscious of keeping a close eye on DS in case it got out of hand (either way!!) Most of the other mums who's children he was playing with were all saying similar things &#034;they're boys being boys&#034; and when their DS's were coming up to them saying &#034;x did this&#034; etc, they were replying with. &#034;play nicely and tell him not to do it again&#034;.
I like to think we've raised DS to be independant, so this is a similar attitude to what I have. Boys will be boys and there will be a certain amount of play fighting and if DS comes to me saying &#034;x did this&#034; then I know that DS will have probably either done something back or will end up doing something back.
So all was going well until the last 5 minutes when as they were all running around a child fell into the back of a chair. DS was behind the child when it happened but I saw it happen and DS did not push him.
DS immediately said to me &#034;it wasn't me&#034; and I replied with &#034;I know it wasn't don't worry you're not in trouble&#034;
The child who fell into the chair (I'll call him Fred) walked off crying and a few of the mums were trying to tell Freds mum that he was crying as had fell into a chair. She finally got up to go over to him when I saw DS talking to him and I got up to go over too, as didn't want the mum thinking DS had pushed Fred into the chair. 

At that moment, DS hit Fred in the face.
Immediately I opened my mouth to tell him off, but got beaten to it by Fred's mum who pointed her finger at him and shouted &#034;no, you don't do that&#034;. I was right behind her when she did it and said to DS &#034;that wasn't nice now go and say sorry straight away&#034; 
DS went to Fred and said sorry and Fred's mum said &#034;I should think so too you little bully!!&#034;.
I took DS away to the table where we were sat, to calm him down and to ask why he hit. He explained because Fred was saying that he'd pushed him, which he hadn't.
When DS was calmer I went over to Fred and his mum and asked if Fred was ok and said &#034;sorry&#034; myself. The reply was &#034;your DS needs to learn to use his mouth and not his fists&#034;
I said I appreciated that it was not nice what he did and that he had said sorry and that I had told him off and I had apologised too. I also said that it wasn't DS who pushed him into the chair as I had seen that, but clarified that that did not excuse the fact that DS did hit Fred. 
She was obviously angry as I would have been in the same situation. I said I did not want bad feeling and wanted to sort things out there and she just replied with &#034;ok well it's done, let's say no more about it&#034; as she walked away. She wouldn't look at me and did not say it with a &#034;these things happen&#034; tone!!

It was time to leave then anyway and so I sat calmly with DS waiting for her to leave, and also for the birthday boy to stop handing out party bags so DS could go and say thank you.
When DS had said thank you and we left, Fred and his mum were hanging about / waiting near the exit. I said a casual &#034;see u later&#034; as I walked out the door and she ignored me / didn't speak.
My mind is working overdrive as I am worried she was waiting for the other mums to 'let off steam' which inevitably will involve her saying negative comments about my child. I am also annoyed actually at the way she spoke to my child. She seemed quite harsh, especially when she knew I was behind her. I am not in anyway excusing what he did. But calling him a 'bully' when he is only 5 is a bit strong I feel.
Maybe I would have said the same had it been the other way round, but I don't think I would have said it to the childs face.
I am also worried about all the stupid schoolgate politics which may occur, how she will react to me on Monday morning, how will the other mums act towards me if she has spread rumours / comments.
I tried every way possible to resolve the situation amicably but am a bit of a worrier and feel quite down about her response. She is normally a friendly outgoing relaxed sort of person, but I've seen another side to her which I don't like.
I don't know if this makes any difference to the situation, but she is a single parent, only has one child and I know she has found it difficult letting go. During the kids reception year, we were asked half way through to stay at the bottom of the steps and let the children walk up to the classroom on their own, but she was one of the mums who continued to go up to the classroom door. 
Maybe she is just insecure and snapped at someone hurting her child. Maybe she doesn't realise / understand that it's equally as difficult for the mother of the child who hit out as it is for the child who hits. I've been in both situations with DS in the past and it's just as horrible a feeling when he hits out as it is when he gets hit.
Any advice to help me stop worrying will be more than greatefully received.

Ash69irn,"I'm hoping that someone here can help me out with some advice. Lately my DS who's just turned 9 has been getting harrassed by this pack of four brothers. They're from a well known family of scumbags in the area so it's no wonder they are the way they are. 

I think it probably started about a year ago, they would jump in our back garden and tap on the back door, but when I went to chase them they would just stand and pull stupid faces and repeat what I said. In the end I just started ignoring them and that seemed to do the trick. Back then they weren't bothering DS at all, they seemed to have it in for me more than anything.

They cleared off and I didn't get any bother from them until about a month ago when they all decided to gang up on DS when he was out playing one night and started punching and kicking him. Fortunately I taught him well and he fought back and fended them off, but now I can tell he's worried about running into them at school or when he's out incase they attack him again. It breaks my heart that he's frightened of these little shits :(

I went to the school but they gave me the usual crap and I'm pretty convinced they're going to do nothing. Apparently they have to deal with these particular kids and their parents all the time so what they say probably doesn't make any difference to them. These kids have now started knocking on my door and running away which is freaking DS out even more and also now disturbing my DD who's only one. Talking to their parents is not an option as they're the kind who would blame me and probably try to kick my head in. I know their names and where they live but I'm at a loss of what to do. I don't want to make things worse for DS but I don't want to just let this run its course until they get bored and find someone else to bother.

He has been complaining about being hit for some time now and recently weals were seen on his neck so I complained to the teacher about this attack, pointing out his reluctance to go to school. She spoke to offending children and their parents.
However my son , perhaps out of frustration , or inability to express his upset, or(as teacher thinks) possible autism decided today to act out of character and tell the dinner-lady he wished she were dead. Later after being told by class assistant to sit on the mat he decided to attack her (clawing at her arms). He also says he dislikes another teacher but can't say why.
Perhaps he needs the support of the Behavioral Support Unit? Or should I get him some counselling from Children's Mental Health? Or should I see his behavior as a frustrated cry for help in a class he doesn't want to be in 'cos his happiness has been ruined? Should I consider any of the above or an alternative?

skip to september 2013 one the first day of reception we see this same boy. He was put in my sons class (we didnt even think about this fact until that day) my son had ran all the way to school excited then froze when he saw this little boy and told us it was the nasty boy. on day two i went into school and explained the bullying had started again as my son told me the boy had followed him EVERYWHERE and hit him few times and called him names. ( i have seen this many times). they said they would keep an eye on it all. the next day i get a phone call saying my son was in a lot of trouble as he had hit some one (never had issues at school before) turns out him and this boy had been annoying each other all day and resulted in my son hitting the boy in his privates. tbh i was glad my son finally hit back in all this time he stood there and took it. the teacher said the boys just grate on each other and would keep them away from each other where possible. over the next 2 weeks it kept happening the boy would hurt my son infront of me and in class and my son would hurt others almost like getting attention. then one the 26th sept my son was playing on a scooter on the play ground before school the boy kept kicking the back wheel to trip my son i told him to stop. then he called my son names and carried on. The mum stood there yet again. my son gave up and walked off to play on some tyres the bully then shoved my son off. as my son was holding a toy he couldnt stop him self. he still has the massive bruise on his head he had a huge lump. i flipped i was taken to the head where i demaned the boy be removed my sons class or i will pull my son out of school. They removed him but the mums excuse for not stopping any of it was the play ground was busy and she couldnt get to him. so thanks to her we line up in a diff spot that is actually worse to see you kids. Any way that weekend my son could hardly walk with out pain. by the Tuesday i took him to hospital turns out he had a sprained knee which will take weeks to heal. They said we are lucky it didnt break. My son has a physical disability so this sprain will take even longer to heal. his still on full meds to help. I still see this boy doing this behaviour to other children and it makes me so angry. He knows to stay away from my son but hasnt actually had a punishment for what he did. He loves being in the new class!!! 

I know the boy has behavior issues as i have heard this discussed but my son has ADHD and ODD and never had issues at school until this. My son and this boy are on different rule system to the other children due to this and since the bully was removed from his class my son is getting full stickers every day! The teacher said its nice to see him behave i said it is due to the bully being removed but she didn't believe me! 

im hoping this is all over but i cant get over seeing my child like that from the boy shoving him. It was very hard and ilooked at the mum to see her stood there watching! I feel so sorry for the boy as his mum obvs has given up but if that is the case she gave up very quick as this has been going on since they were two! The school insist this isn't bullying but i was. I now worry every day he goes to school!

Deleted profile,"DD is 10 and has been having ongoing bullying issues for a long time. The school have said they have been doing various things but it clearly hasn't worked. She was waiting for the bus home on Fri and another girl from her class chased her and pushed her to the floor. DD hurt her knee and her hand. A man waiting at the bus stop helped her up and said she should go back into school as the stop is just outside. She did and saw loads of members of staff but all they did was ask her to move her hand and then put her out of the door even though she was limping at the time. Why didn't they call me FFS :rargh:

I called the school when she got home but there was no answer. I called the police and arranged an appointment for today. I had to take DD to A &amp; E to have her hand x-rayed thankfully it wasn't broken. 

We spoke to the Police today and they took a statement from DD and got me to check and sign it. I am so livid, the school have let this go on and on and on and kept telling me DD is sensitive and isn't concentrating in lessons. What the hell do they expect!!!

I am going to have to really work hard to not let rip on Monday morning.

Aly14env,"For the past three months, my son has started coming home mentioning the same boy in his class has &#034;bullied&#034; him. He claims that this boys follows him around and pushes him every break time.

When in reception, my son also accused a couple of other children of bullying him, but these were isolated occasions and he never mentioned them again. However, this time, he seems to have been pushed, kicked or excluded from games every day. 

I have seen this particular boy out of school and he does play 'rough' which my son isn't used to as he spends more time wi me than my husband, so he doesn't engage in much rough and tumble play. Consequently, I sometimes think he misinterprets play for bullying. He is quite sensitive and smaller than most of e other children. He says nobody wants to play with him at break time and that this other boy is now starting to get other boys to 'gang up' on him.

I've written to the head of the school as my son's teacher is off on long-term illness and I have a meeting in the morning. I want to give this boy the benefit of the doubt and hope it is just boys being a bit boisterous, but I have a niggling feeling there's more to it. I also get the impression that things are escalating. 

The problem is that he goes to a tiny school with only 50ish pupils in total (infants and juniors) and therefore issues like this can quickly cause rifts in the community. To make it worse, we are business owners and quite well known in the area, so my son is also well-known and I'm worried this will taint everything for us.

Does anyone have any advice on how to go forward?For the past three months, my son has started coming home mentioning the same boy in his class has ""bullied"" him.

Sar40ioz,Ok I'm not sure how to deal with this my daughter is 4 and had her best friend for about a year and spend a lot of time together as myself and her mum r really good friends when there is just them 2 everything is great and they play lovely although I have started noticing more and more that her friend drops her and leaves her out when ever other children are around and now my daughter knows if there are other girls there they won't want to play with her! At first I thought I was over reacting but it's happening more and more and really upsets me first there is 3 of them that go to same ballet class and its alway mine that's the one that's left out if need to get partners and at nursery she has come home number of time and said she wasn't aloud to play with her friend because so and so where there and the worse one I witnessed was we all went to another girls house for lunch and the other two were sat in a corner playing and I hard them saying to mine who was sat slighty back alone we don't wanna play with u we playing together in a teasing voice and my daughter started filling up but she keeps things to her self and doesn't let us know what's upsetting her but I can tell it is as became tearful and seems to just put up with the fact no one wants to play with her and plays alone ! I am also getting cross because once when I was with my friend I made a point of explaining to my daughter how she is not to be mean or leave anyone out as u would make them feel really sad and she understood and is now really good at including everyone when she plays but I can't understand why my friends mum won't say that to her child to make her see that she is upsetting mine!Ok I'm not sure how to deal with this my daughter is 4 and had her best friend for about a year and spend a lot of time together as myself and her mum r really good friends when there is just them 2 everything is great and they play lovely although I have started noticing more and more that her friend drops her and leaves her out when ever other children are around and now my daughter knows if there are other girls there they won't want to play with her!

daw02lzl,"why is it that we try to teach our children to behave and they get no rewards yet if you have a child who is a bully they are rewarded for thier bad or very bad behavior. 
if our child is bad at home we dicipline them as we would never dream of rewarding this sort of behavior yet this sort of behavior is rewarded at school every day.
for parents whose children our the victems of these children we are told that it is our childs fault as they do not socialize with these bullies well, or that the bully comes from a bad family.
how can anyone be freinds with someone who is calling you names, hitting ,kicking or attempting things thats even worse.
if these children do come from bad families fine teach them that bad behavior is not allowed .
i would love to know why schools and LEA's think that giving the bullies free stuff such as lap tops, free holiday(to boost there confidence) and if they get chucked out of school free one to one teaching, while the victim of these children are blamed for being bullied, they are ignored, and they have to carry on in a class of 30 odd other kids.
maybe we should all teach our children the way the schools do be naughty and you get what you want and you do not have to pay for the consequences of thier actions, not like in the really world.
i am speaking from experience on this subject and i'm sure there are many thousands of parents who have been there done that or are about to find out what it is really like being a parent of a child who has been bullied in school. you are about to find out that as far as your school is concerned your child(the victim) is at fault or you are a bad parent. the parent with a child who is a bully will get a much more pleasant experience as everything will be payed for you and you won't have to spend a penny on your childs education. for those who have had enough and decide to home educate you will have to pay for your childs education as the goverment don't help the victims, only the bullies.
sorry this is a long post but something needs to be said as there are thousands of children suffering every day in school all over the country and no one wants to know, how many times has a head said (on tv)they do not have a bullying problem after yet another child comitts suicide or there has been another vicous attack in the schoolwhy is it that we try to teach our children to behave and they get no rewards yet if you have a child who is a bully they are rewarded for thier bad or very bad behavior. if our child is bad at home we dicipline them as we would never dream of rewarding this sort of behavior yet this sort of behavior is rewarded at school every day.for parents whose children our the victems of these children we are told that it is our childs fault as they do not socialize with these bullies well, or that the bully comes from a bad family.how can anyone be freinds with someone who is calling you names, hitting ,kicking or attempting things thats even worse.if these children do come from bad families fine teach them that bad behavior is not allowed .i would love to know why schools and LEA's think that giving the bullies free stuff such as lap tops, free holiday(to boost there confidence) and if they get chucked out of school free one to one teaching, while the victim of these children are blamed for being bullied, they are ignored, and they have to carry on in a class of 30 odd other kids.maybe we should all teach our children the way the schools do be naughty and you get what you want and you do not have to pay for the consequences of thier actions, not like in the really world.i am speaking from experience on this subject and i'm sure there are many thousands of parents who have been there done that or are about to find out what it is really like being a parent of a child who has been bullied in school. you are about to find out that as far as your school is concerned your child(the victim) is at fault or you are a bad parent. the parent with a child who is a bully will get a much more pleasant experience as everything will be payed for you and you won't have to spend a penny on your childs education. for those who have had enough and decide to home educate you will have to pay for your childs education as the goverment don't help the victims, only the bullies.sorry this is a long post but something needs to be said as there are thousands of children suffering every day in school all over the country and no one wants to know, how many times has a head said (on tv)they do not have a bullying problem after yet another child comitts suicide or there has been another vicous attack in the school",20,"3,560", 09-11-2006 at 11.10PM

ASK.FM is linked to a number of recent teen suicides (6)

Then another so called friend comments on the post and starts making fun of this so called person.

Its not just so called friends either its family, they will write posts which are clearly aimed at certain people and then say oh no its not about you its about someone else.

Anyway she is being bullied again. She's being verbally harrassed constantly. Being told&#034;'you've got nits&#034; &#034;you've got no friends&#034; &#034;nobody likes you, you should just run away&#034; this happens even in lessons but quietly so the teacher doesn't hear.

She has been threatened and even spat on. She told a teacher she'd been spat on and the teacher told her &#034;go and tell him to grow up&#034; Which she did and he then spat on her again several times, she said she didn't tell the teacher again because she knew they wouldn't help.

She told me she does have some friends but they are now being picked on because they are her friends. She sadly told me I don't think I'll have any friends soon but I understand they don't want to be bullied. That broke my heart.

I went to the school and they've said they will sort it and investigate why this teacher didn't do anything about the spitting. But today DD told me one of the main bullies who shoved her into the desk, causing her to hit her head, has told them it was an accident. :shock:
Yeah, course it was. Pull the other one, it has bells on!!! He did it because she was picking up his pencil when it fell under her

my son has been bullied very badly in year 4 (now just started yr 5) it went on for months i was down the school every day complaining but nothing happened well it did the kids were put on report which didnt work...report goes as this - green report for 6 weeks if you dont behave in the 6 weeks you go on amber for 2 weeks if you still dont behave you go on red for 1 week if you dont behave its goodbye collect your things and find a new school....now all the kids as soon as they got amber started being nice so for 3 weeks there was no bullying no name calling no stealing nothing our son soon perked up till we noticed the pattern of this report card!

he was getting punched pinched hair pulled name calling pushed tripped things taken slapped you get the picture...he didnt tell us at first and when he did i hit the roof the school said they had not seen anything at all and my son had not told any teachers (in fact he had told the dinner ladies but they had failed to pass the message on!) and they couldnt do anything about it after months of going down the school and near enough exploding to get my point across trust me i had tried the calm route and that is when 4 boys ganged up on him in the playground beat him up my son threw snow at them and then they threatened him if he was to even look in their direction ever again they would ping elastic bands in his face (these are 8 and 9 years old!!) so cue me down the school speaking to the head teacher who tells me there are no bullying issues within her school and i should take my son out to find a school i am confident with!! i posted it on facebook and all my friends who have kids at the school spoke out and their kids spoke out too i cried the passion of the kids to stop bullying was amazing the whole year had been pulled up on bullying and we thought that was that... we did have a parental contract due to my son not wanting to go to school.

nope it carried on just little things i still was going down the school i ignored the normal kids winding each other up but spoke out at physical or pin pointing bullying to my son still adamant there is no bullying in the school i fell on deaf ears then thats when it happened i hit the roof big time....my son was in class reading books the teacher had left the room for 5 mins 2 kids come over to my son and wanted the book he was reading he wouldnt let them have it so he was punched in the back and head hair was pulled he actually had little clumps of hair missing scratched pinched and kicked he ran out the class and got told off!! 
so that day after school he told us i went down the school and spoke to the head in reception area while parents and kids were coming in for judo lessons...she didnt want to invite me in her office so while everyone is walking though they can hear that the school failed my son and head still saying they have no bullying in this school!....i calmy told her what had happened she replied that my son must of made some of it up thats when i saw red and explained that i put my child in your care you are responsible for his care to make sure he learns in a environment with no danger a place he can come without being scared a place he wants to come if anyone touches a hair on his head at all or name calling or any form of bullying carries on i will contact the police governors and ofsted do i make myself crystal clear!? and walked out and left her gob smacked my son was jumping with excitement and i was shaking im only 5 foot the head is nearly 6 foot and quite frighting lol 

and that was actually the end of the bullying it took me to threaten the school for them to actually do something at the last meeting with the educational social worker about the parental contract we had explained all this and they said i personally dont think you should of had this in place but its standard attendance falls we have to do this which we understood our son now is a very angry person its not the usual 9 yr old too big for his boots he is quite violent shouts and really does argue with everyone we have asked the school for help but no luck but the doctor has sent him to CAMHS and we have an appointment next month so hopefully they can help maybe counselling its been nearly 5 months since its all stopped all i want is my little boy back who loves street dance singing telling jokes :(

if your child is being bullied do not stand and wait for the school/parent to act....act yourself and get it stopped i am seeing what bullying can do to a child i truly believe my son is now depressed at the age of 9 because of bullies!himy son has been bullied very badly in year 4 (now just started yr 5) it went on for months i was down the school every day complaining but nothing happened well it did the kids were put on report which didnt work...report goes as this - green report for 6 weeks if you dont behave in the 6 weeks you go on amber for 2 weeks if you still dont behave you go on red for 1 week if you dont behave its goodbye collect your things and find a new school....now all the kids as soon as they got amber started being nice so for 3 weeks there was no bullying no name calling no stealing nothing our son soon perked up till we noticed the pattern of this report card!he was getting punched pinched hair pulled name calling pushed tripped things taken slapped you get the picture...he didnt tell us at first and when he did i hit the roof the school said they had not seen anything at all and my son had not told any teachers (in fact he had told the dinner ladies but they had failed to pass the message on!) and they couldnt do anything about it after months of going down the school and near enough exploding to get my point across trust me i had tried the calm route and that is when 4 boys ganged up on him in the playground beat him up my son threw snow at them and then they threatened him if he was to even look in their direction ever again they would ping elastic bands in his face (these are 8 and 9 years old!!) so cue me down the school speaking to the head teacher who tells me there are no bullying issues within her school and i should take my son out to find a school i am confident with!! i posted it on facebook and all my friends who have kids at the school spoke out and their kids spoke out too i cried the passion of the kids to stop bullying was amazing the whole year had been pulled up on bullying and we thought that was that... we did have a parental contract due to my son not wanting to go to school.nope it carried on just little things i still was going down the school i ignored the normal kids winding each other up but spoke out at physical or pin pointing bullying to my son still adamant there is no bullying in the school i fell on deaf ears then thats when it happened i hit the roof big time....my son was in class reading books the teacher had left the room for 5 mins 2 kids come over to my son and wanted the book he was reading he wouldnt let them have it so he was punched in the back and head hair was pulled he actually had little clumps of hair missing scratched pinched and kicked he ran out the class and got told off!! so that day after school he told us i went down the school and spoke to the head in reception area while parents and kids were coming in for judo lessons...she didnt want to invite me in her office so while everyone is walking though they can hear that the school failed my son and head still saying they have no bullying in this school!....i calmy told her what had happened she replied that my son must of made some of it up thats when i saw red and explained that i put my child in your care you are responsible for his care to make sure he learns in a environment with no danger a place he can come without being scared a place he wants to come if anyone touches a hair on his head at all or name calling or any form of bullying carries on i will contact the police governors and ofsted do i make myself crystal clear!? and walked out and left her gob smacked my son was jumping with excitement and i was shaking im only 5 foot the head is nearly 6 foot and quite frighting lol and that was actually the end of the bullying it took me to threaten the school for them to actually do something at the last meeting with the educational social worker about the parental contract we had explained all this and they said i personally dont think you should of had this in place but its standard attendance falls we have to do this which we understood our son now is a very angry person its not the usual 9 yr old too big for his boots he is quite violent shouts and really does argue with everyone we have asked the school for help but no luck but the doctor has sent him to CAMHS and we have an appointment next month so hopefully they can help maybe counselling its been nearly 5 months since its all stopped all i want is my little boy back who loves street dance singing telling jokes if your child is being bullied do not stand and wait for the school/parent to act....act yourself and get it stopped i am seeing what bullying can do to a child i truly believe my son is now depressed at the age of 9 because of bullies!",8,"1,470", 15-09-2013 at 8.16AM  
Mis48pso,"So my niece (10) is being bullied at school and also by phone/internet by 3 'friends' at school
and im a bit concerned as she is getting really upset about it.
My sister (her mum) has been in the school about it but the teachers do nothing about it as some are related to these children that are bullying. 
My sister has considered changing her schools but she only has 1 more year left there.

We are looking for a bit of advice on what should happen next, What would you do?
My sister does let her on Facebook which in my opinion she is to young and they bully her on there like they do when shes at school.

for example i taken my niece to have her hair cut yesterday and i chose how the salon cut her hair and the girl wrote to her today 'why have you copied my hair' her hair looks nothing like there's as she actually had it the same as mine but they continued going on sending messages of abuse.

My sister has talked to the parents of these children about it and they say they will sort it out but don't do anything about itSo my niece (10) is being bullied at school and also by phone/internet by 3 'friends' at schooland im a bit concerned as she is getting really upset about it.My sister (her mum) has been in the school about it but the teachers do nothing about it as some are related to these children that are bullying.

Deleted profile,"Hi everyone, was looking for some opinions on whats been happening with my daughter at school. She unfortunately is one of those children that seems to be picked on all the time, shes a little different, emotionally and socially younger than her peers, struggles to concentrate and pay attention, daydreams a lot, distracted are her main issues, she is also beautiful, funny, generous, fairly quiet, well mannered amongst other things.
Shes had problems in previous years with bullying but it is this last 2 years it has been at its worst, this year she was picked on by 3 boys, this was eventually dealt with positively after me going in several times. A group of girls have also picked on her throughout the year name calling, running away from her, refusing to sit near her, pushing her stuff off the bench in pe, that kind of thing, again I went in cue an assembly on being nice to each other and name calling, it continued I went in at least on three other occasion and saw the head, he said he would deal with it and i thought he had. My daughter stopped telling me things, seemed ok so i thought all was well, then she began to refuse to go to school and saying everyone hates me, teachers dont listen, dinnerladies dont listen, u dont care, we are repeatedly late for school as i cant get her out the door, I tell school whats happening, head says he will check in with her see if shes ok, we struggle on. Then almost at the end of school year one day she breaks her heart to me, the same group of kids plus a couple more were winding her up about a subject she knows well as she does tend to obsess about things then move on to something else, she does give a huge reaction which we have talked about trying to change, then in the same incident, she gets called an offensive racist sentence, told the teacher, she ignored her. We were fuming and my oh phoned school said had enough and we were putting a complaint in, then they dealt with the boy, but not the others.... She has seen a community paed for other issues and she deduced that while she may have some minor learning issues, most of it is anxiety from unhappiness at school. Im not trying to blame the school completely, im sure some of the blame is ours and my daughters, I have always said this to school and asked for help, anyway after that we have decided to remove her from that school, she is so happy not to be going back. A while later we are chatting and she divulged that there had been other incidents of her being picked on, she refused to go to games as the girls were being vile to her, she was marched to the head, he then shouted at her and told her that it was not an incident of being picked on or bullied and if she told us and we phoned or visited him to discuss it he would be furious with her, he had also stopped her after school (shes always last, as cant organise herself) and told her in a cross way that she was not to tell us of any incidents unless she had told him first. I appreciate it can be annoying to have a child keep complaining of things that others then deny, but it doesnt mean it hasnt happended, also a child that is repeatedly picked on and has anxiety can become confused as to whats school life and whats bullying, surely thats what we should be helping with. I also have repeatedly asked for their opinion on the root cause so we can work on it, they told me when we said we were putting in a complaint that she annoys other kids on purpose, im not saying she doesnt i dont know what she is like at school, which is why i asked for help, but why only tell me in the last 2 weeks of the year? The head denied in our final meeting that I have been in and told him of bullying incidents, he said he couldnt recall the conversations, even though one event i witnessed as i was helping out with a visit, and was visibly upset about it. The thing that worries me the most is that he allegedly told her not to tell us things and frightened her death in doing so, surely this isnt allowed? And the way they deal with it, I know of several other kids with similar issues and am concerned for them and any other future kids it may affect.

Some are around age 3 and their parents doors are closed and they were out until 10.45 through the holidays.

So naturally I told her off to stop it and had a street kids mum saw it.

Then her crazed mother actually ventured out from her veranda to start shouting and bawling at me and she was calling the police, so she got a piece of her mind back.

Ali13lso,"My 14 year old son was assaulted at school 12 days ago by 3 lads in the year above him. Apparently they have been targeting boys younger than them. The outcome of this was my son received a badly broken finger and heavy brushing and swelling to his hand. This was all caught on CCTV. My son is now in a plaster cast and has to have weekly hospital visits for X-rays to check whether he needs an op.
Needless to say I am very very upset. The school have taken it seriously,the main perpetrator was excluded for three days(bet he loved that) and then allowed back in school although he was internally excluded. My son has lost his confidence and has been unable to face going back. I decided to let him go back in September once his cast was off and he didn't feel so self conscious. It's such a shame as my boy is a confident boy who is getting on well at school and I'm so cross that these boys have been going around the school attacking younger boys and now they may have taken my boys confidence away. Every time I look at his cast I just feel so angry.
My 17 year old daughter says that the school is full of nastiness and you have to be really tough to get through it. She said some of the other kids have been laughing in front of her over what happened to my son. There are currently 18 girls that are pregnant.

Susannah J(11),"People will always judge on appearances and nothing will ever change that, we don't, in fact we can't have a good old chat with everyone we see and find out their life story. The problem is not making the judgement, it is acting as if the judgement is accurate just because we have made it. It is fine to think that the 15 year old walking down the street with her child is a slut, but to treat her as one, to call out vicious names to her, with no idea of who she is or what she has been through other than the judgement in our own heads, is wrong. Make judgements all you want, but make the distinction between judgement and truth. Truth can be verified, it is not something you can know just by looking. It is possible that your judgement is true, but it is just as likely that it is not and if you are wrong, you, and others like you, can cause irreperable damage to a person's self esteem. So, make your judgements, but if you are not willing to take the time to discover if your judgement is accurate, shut the hell up and leave people be.People will always judge on appearances and nothing will ever change that, we don't, in fact we can't have a good old chat with everyone we see and find out their life story.

I can barely imagine how angry they must feel.
Having since spoken to her, she is terribly sorry now. although she realises that she should not kick anyone, she has and I need advice in how to handle this.
The school meeting was excruciating, both her class teacher and the headmistress were understandably upset on behalf of the child, however I received the brunt if their disgust and found them unprepared. They are calling in a specialist to assess my daughter, along with other children, as this is a reported case. 
I have not been invited to join this assessment and have asked to meet this person, and the head again, with my daughters father next Friday. 
I asked the head teacher if in her experience, my daughter was a bully and she said yes. I also asked the head to help me to change her and give her the help she needs to recognise that her actions are unacceptable.

How can I help her to see what she has done wrong, move on and overturn this bully stigma and stand on her own feet without the need to please her friend?",3,"1,113", 28-06-2013 at 8.20PM

Deleted profile,"So there's a party on the Saturday. nothing happens, Very nice party. Then on the Sunday this mum's son from reception class comes rushing up to me with a smile on my face and asks where my ds is. I am confused about this as my ds says her son is very rude and he doesn't want to play with him. He also kicked my ds a few weeks ago and my ds has let this bug him. He walks off from him if he gets grabbed by him. So, this kid seeks out my ds and then slaps him repeatedly, I see my ds get fed up and walk off into the ball pit. Her son follows him and again, hits my ds repeatedly. I watch the parents wondering if they are going to discipline this boy. My son gets fed up and clobbers this kid with one of those big cushion things. AND THEN.... the mother, who stands at six feet tall and is pretty wide as well, goes over to my ds and starts aggressively asking him why he is hitting her kid! I ask her to calm down, she is awful and accuses my ds of &#034;terrorizing&#034; her son. Swears at me, which I challenge at a kid's party and they leave. I attempt to leave and get sat down with a cup of tea. I find out she's been talking about this behind my back for four weeks, so before she leaves I tell her she is childish and she should have spoken to me about it. She then accuses me of doing something to her mum. I write to her mum. Her mum writes back saying she wants nothing to do with it. (Her mum has babysat our kids since they were babies). I write to the school. School says NO bullying going on with ANY children. 

My next course of action after her ds sticking a safety pin into my son's leg on sports day : - I ask this mum in the school playground in a straight forward manner if she is happier now the school says there's been no &#034;terrorizing&#034; by my ds and she replies that the playground is no place for an argument. As I am not looking for an argument I say she should have spoken to me about it. She replies that I have a lot on my plate and her coming up to me is the last thing I need. Now this is the interesting part. I have got a lot on my plate because we are renovating a house. A nice big house. She walked in to that house on my invitation to have a look round, she came out saying the house is lovely and she is jealous. That was just before the four week period she is claiming. My son also got a certificate at that time for outstanding behaviour and manners. Could this be coincidence??? She then said (in the playground) to forget about it. NO APOLOGY!!! Then, for the next school week she arranges to drop off and pick up her son from the other school entrance. My husband is really perplexed by this. We are very straight forward approachable people with a good sense of humour. She can't walk around our new house and then claim not to be able to talk to us! We are older parents and she's been aware of us for over ten years she knows we can take a conversation. I have welcomed her into my house with her mum to encourage a possible relationship but she's never reciprocated.

The school are keeping them apart but my son has developed an anxiety disorder (he feels the need to go to the loo a LOT!) and he says he is scared of her and that her son keeps telling him he is a bully and he kicks and slaps people. My ds is genuinely upset. The school don't want to make a link. I keep trying to make him laugh but this evening I had to explain that this mum should not have done that and she was wrong. That he shouldn't have to learn about things like this at 5 years old but she has given us no choice but to tell him that adults can be out of order, so to speak. 

The school thinks it will die down over the summer holidays. Now I ask you...... do you think it will? I can never trust her around my children. What advice does anyone have? Has anyone had a similar experience? It's difficult to see something for what it is sometimes when you're in it and busy so any replies much appreciated. :hug:So there's a party on the Saturday.  nothing happens, Very nice party.  Then on the Sunday this mum's son from reception class comes rushing up to me with a smile on my face and asks where my ds is.  I am confused about this as my ds says her son is very rude and he doesn't want to play with him.  He also kicked my ds a few weeks ago and my ds has let this bug him.  He walks off from him if he gets grabbed by him.  So, this kid seeks out my ds and then slaps him repeatedly, I see my ds get fed up and walk off into the ball pit.  Her son follows him and again, hits my ds repeatedly.  I watch the parents wondering if they are going to discipline this boy.  My son gets fed up and clobbers this kid with one of those big cushion things.  AND THEN.... the mother, who stands at six feet tall and is pretty wide as well, goes over to my ds and starts aggressively asking him why he is hitting her kid!  I ask her to calm down, she is awful and accuses my ds of ""terrorizing"" her son.

Vicky C(168),"My son is in 1st year at secondary school &amp; has been targeted by a group of bullies :(

We moved to the area during the summer holidays so he didn't know anyone at the school when he started but settled in quickly &amp; made some good friends (mainly older than him).

There is a group of 4 boys who have been picking on him for last few months. Firstly started with verbal abuse, calling him fat (he has a wee belly, def not fat), sayin he did rude things with his grandmother, hiding his gym kit etc. The group r popular &amp; although the most of the class do not join in they do laugh &amp; none of them talk 2 my son.

A few weeks ago things changed with them starting 2 trip him up in corrider, punching him in arm &amp; slap his back at swimming.

We contacted the school &amp; made them aware of the situation &amp; they said they would monitor it. On Friday 1 of the boys punched my son just above his privates so hard that he was bruised. He didnt want 2 tell the teacher so said he was not well so he could go home. Upon picking his up he told us wot had happened so we went straight back in2 the school &amp; told them! The boy involved was given a 3 day internal exclusion.

Since returning 2 school y'day he said everyone is calling him a snitch &amp; still tormenting him, includin the boy who punched him on fri! 
He doesn't want us 2 tell the school anymore that happens cos they will just get on at him more.

Please help wot do we do, hes so miserable :(My son is in 1st year at secondary school & has been targeted by a group of bullies We moved to the area during the summer holidays so he didn't know anyone at the school when he started but settled in quickly & made some good friends (mainly older than him).There is a group of 4 boys who have been picking on him for last few months.

Sue09kxm,"Hi there, not sure if I am posting this in the right bit but I would really welcome some advice if anyone can help. It's midnight and I just can't sleep with worry about this,
My son has been systematically bullied at school now for about a year. He is only 6 and 4 other boys in his class jump on him in the playground and punch and kick him. He is scared of going to school and is worried all the time. We have finally taken it to the Head teacher ( after attempts by his class teacher to stop this failed dismally)and to be fair she has stomped on the bullies pretty hard so for the last couple of days the boys have just ignored my son. We really hoped that this would be the end of it and that things would get better but now my son has started being very secretive and sloping off to his room. We discovered this evening that he is doing this so he can change out of his pants and put on a nappy which he then has a wee in. I am really disturbed by this. I don't know if its a control issue because he feels helpless. I tried to talk to my son but he just went mad into the kind of tantrum he had when he was 2 ( I should add that my son has been dry now for years). I just don't know what I can do to help him. We are going to see the Head teacher again tomorrow about this and try to get an appointment with the school councillor to see what she says about it. 
My lovely happy son is becoming a shell of his former self. 
If anyone can offer advice on what we can do as parents I really would be very grateful

vic43bjb,"My daughter (6yo) is being emotionally blackmailed by a 'friend' at her school.

We're thinking along the lines that we should make any explanation really simple for her ie no-one, apart from teachers/other adults and us, have the job of telling her what to do, it's not up to her classmates to boss her around, and if they try to she should go and tell someone.

We're also going to have a word with the teacher just to make sure they're aware something is going on.

Lau02xmq,"My daughter is being bullied by one girl but has also had another incident with 2 girls from the year above (year2).

DD1 has been coming home for a while now saying that one particular girl has been pulling her hair, lifting her dress up (they are not allowed to wear trousers), breaking her bag tags that have her name on for her book bag etc.

I wrote a couple of letters to the class teacher who then dealt with the situation.

Since Feb half term, DD1 has become increasingly difficult to get up in the morning and complains she has a headache or belly ache, but never really made me aware of anything untoward happening at school. She has also been picking on her sister (3yrs old) more and more, DD2 is very strong willed and will &#034;clonk&#034; DD1 back!

Just before easter i had wrote the letters to the teacher and thought the issues were solved.

Last week, DD1 became very withdrawn and was crying alot and clinging to my leg in the morning. On Tuesday she came home with a graze on her knee, this girl had pushed her over on the playground, DD1 told the lunchtime supervisor and she was given a plaster and she was also pinched on the chest. 

Wednesday,

Thursday, an incident with the 2 older girls, in DD1s own words, &#034;they tried to strangle me&#034;, i asked how they did it, &#034;with their arm and hand round my neck&#034;, i then asked what happened after, &#034;they dragged me across the playground to the tyres&#034;. 

Naturally i was very upset and extremely concerned for her welfare, i really didnt want to send her to school Friday, I sent her in with a letter outlining all incidents from that week, also requesting a meeting. I was in pieces, so at 10am i rang the school and asked for the Deputy Head to ring me, i then discussed all the incidents and the effect that it is having on DD1. DD1 was taken to one side with the Deputy and DD1 told her of everything that happened. Then DD1 and the one girl was taken to the Head and the girl lost her lunchtime. That is the only time DD1 had a playtime without being excluded from playing or being hurt.

Today (Monday), DD1 didnt want to go again, although she didnt say this, it took me half an hour to get her out of bed (she was up at the crack of dawn at the weekend!). All the way in the car she cried saying her neck hurt, I spoke to DD2 teacher and she advised i got her seen by the GP and return her to school.

I couldnt get a face to face appointment, but i got a telephone appointment. He said her neck should be ok in a few days, if it isnt go back and then naturally questioned what is being done, as on friday i had to take her to GP for antibiotics as the wound on her knee had became infected.

DD1 went back to school 25 minutes before lunchtime (as i was collecting DD2). DD1 has school dinners, but had missed the chance to pick out her lunch and the reception said she would go and arrange something with the cook.

OH picked her up this afternoon, she told us, that she hadnt been given any lunch, and was sent outside to play whilst the rest of the school ate. She wasnt allowed lunch because she hadnt been there at morning registration to pick it! Also the girl had been pushing her again. She said outright, &#034;i dont want to go to school tomorrow, im scared&#034;.

What do i do now? im waiting for the Deputy to arrange a meeting (hopefully the end of this week). DD1 keeps telling me she feels very sad. I feel cruel sending her to school and her being treated so badly. DD2 teacher had told the girl off for pushing her, so i will ask about it. 

What about the fact that she was refused lunch? i know they have a salad bar, with jacket potatoes on offer every lunchtime or baguettes. How long would it take them to put a baguette together? she is 6 years old and in year 1, i had forgot to send her with her snack and water as my mind was elsewhere worrying about her neck and her emotional state. She had a small snack and a sip of tea when we got home from morning school run at about 10am, and until 4pm when she got home, she had eaten nothing nor drank anything!My daughter is being bullied by one girl but has also had another incident with 2 girls from the year above (year2).DD1 has been coming home for a while now saying that one particular girl has been pulling her hair, lifting her dress up (they are not allowed to wear trousers), breaking her bag tags that have her name on for her book bag etc.I wrote a couple of letters to the class teacher who then dealt with the situation.Since Feb half term, DD1 has become increasingly difficult to get up in the morning and complains she has a headache or belly ache, but never really made me aware of anything untoward happening at school.

Sar30qbb,"She is 8 years old and ad just grown beautiful permanent front teeth.

I got a phone call from school the other week saying that my daughter has been involved in an incident and she's broken her tooth. Went to get her straight away and took her to our dentist. The dentist said there was nothing that could be done at the moment, we have to see whether the roots of her tooh will survive, but he thought most likely they won't as the impact must have been so massive for her tooth to break in the first place.
He x-rayd it and said to come back in 2 months time to have a look at it. He also said it's too short to consider crown if it survives, and to put a fake tooth on it, we would have to wait until my daughter is around 12-13 years old, as that's when the tooth canal usually closes, and nothing would stay in place before that.

What happened was; my daughter was playing with her friend at lunch break, and she heard this boy saying &#034;I'm going to attack xxxx&#034;, and next he came and pushed my daughter and her friend so that my daughter hit her mouth on her friend's forehead so badly that her tooth broke and her friend had to go to the hospital, where they found her tooth embedded in his head and he had have general anesthesia to remove it!

The school was very apologetic, but I have written email asking for a proper details of what happened and this is possible, and wat has te supervision like during the lunch break. I've received a very vague answer, so demanding more details.

I heard this boy has adhd and had his medication recently stopped, but is back on it now. 
Surely, he should have extra supervision? And 2 days previously to this incident, the same boy pushed my daughter into the bushes and she got a strach on her back of that incident...

Any advice how to go about this? Thank you.She is 8 years old and ad just grown beautiful permanent front teeth.I got a phone call from school the other week saying that my daughter has been involved in an incident and she's broken her tooth.

joanne w(633),"I was called into school yesterday and told that my son along with 2 other children had been picking on another boy in their class.

My son has had a good dressing down in school, has apologised to the boy concerned and has had a very big punishment at home.

To move forward I feel that I need to really make him understand fully what he has done and make him feel that he could never do this to another child again.

He was bullied 2 years ago by children 3 years older than him and it knocked his confidence massively and I worry that doing this to another child has in some way felt like its given him some power.

I don't want to let him use him being bullied as a cop out or feeling pressure from the other 2 involved.

Does anybody have any suggestions as to how I can help him to not be a bully as I feel punishments serve a purpose but don't deal with the route cause of the problems they need to be done alongside something else?I was called into school yesterday and told that my son along with 2 other children had been picking on another boy in their class.My son has had a good dressing down in school, has apologised to the boy concerned and has had a very big punishment at home.To move forward I feel that I need to really make him understand fully what he has done and make him feel that he could never do this to another child again.He was bullied 2 years ago by children 3 years older than him and it knocked his confidence massively and I worry that doing this to another child has in some way felt like its given him some power.I don't want to let him use him being bullied as a cop out or feeling pressure from the other 2 involved.Does anybody have any suggestions as to how I can help him to not be a bully as I feel punishments serve a purpose but don't deal with the route cause of the problems they need to be done alongside something else?",2,"1,717", 08-05-2013 at 12.30PM  
cat61uo,"Hi I have a 6 yr old son. He is very friendly and will play with kids of most ages. He can be cheeky but I think it's his age mostly. But to him been cheeky would just be running up to kids he was having an argument with saying na na you can't catch me or something he dosent swear. But a few weeks ago we moved to a new street. There is a little bit who lives next door with his mum and bf. he's 7 and a bit effeminate he likes wearing girls clothes at times and has told his mum he wants to be a girl. Everything seemed ok at first they played together and got on reply well. But after a bit the mother of the boy next door said that chris the 7 yr old is been bullied by the kids in the copper of house on the other side of me. I didn't really want to get involved and thought she might of been exaggerating it at first and they just didn't get on. 
There seemed to be two kids living next door a 13 yr old boy and a little girl who looks about 12. Then after that a 15 yr old girl who has a couple of girl friends over at times and another girl who might be about ten. My son started playing out with chris I didn't notice a problem at first just that he said the girls were mean and didn't want to play with him. I just thought its cause there girls and older. Bi then Helen's mum had a few problems with them saying the girls had been bullying Christopher again and calling him names it seemed. She needed up having a few arguments with there mums. Both she said didn't care about the kids bullying him and didn't do anything about it. Today my son came in saying that the girls had put water on him on purpose he was crying. I said don't play with them and he said he will go play with his friends around the corner who go the same school on the next street. 
So I stood a the door to make sure he went ok and next door was out on both sides and chris dad said to the other sides mum that the 13 yr son had hot Quinn and he had seen it. She said it wasn't true and I think he went in. Quinn walked up past them all the kids were on the street. One about 11 girl blocked my sons way and said something. 
I said you shouldn't be bullying him it's disgusting he's only 6 and his friend Christopher is 7. I didn't notice one of the mums sitting on the floor outside the house she looked like one of the 15 yr old teenagers. By she started saying who are you calling my daughter disgusting your sons been spitting at them swearing etc. all
The time the 15 yr old girl was been cheeky to me saying things like o go in your house how old are you arguing with a 15 yr old. The mum didn't say anything. I said my sons not done anything that wrong her kids are older and should no better if there was any problems they should come
And talk to me about it. I said Quinn has more manners and will listen to me if I tell him he's wrong. All
The kids ate very cheeky they have no respect when talking to adults. Basically I might of raised my voice but they were to. She said she wanted to knock me out . But I was just telling her what was happening and the age difference. She was saying who do you think you are and things. I said they should talk to me and they find seem to listen it be reasonable at all. The parents just seem to be as bad as the children. They started taking amongst themselves so I came in. My son dosent even like going past that way nor to go his friends. I'm not sure what to do now chris mum and bf are moving soon because of the problems with the kids bullying and it's causing her to much stress. I live on my own and there is two of them as a lot of kids. Also I'm not an argumentative person I hate arguing and don't think I have ever said I will knock someone out or been in a fight. They just seem horrible the lot of them. I don't know what to do now as my son likes going out especially In the nice weather. I'm worried now the kids will be cheeky to me when I check on Quinn or walk up and down the street. Also that they might start bullying my son badly. Bit what am I supposes to stay to them now I can't talk to the parents. The parents don't seem to ate about them been cheeky or bullying younger kids? If they call me names and make me
Feel uncomfortable on my own street what can I do? There only kids but it really bothers me. My son has other people to play with and it's not affecting him to much up to now. I'm worried it will get worse as I had it out with the parents. I'm quite a shy quiet person and this upsets me a lot. They seem quite rough and horrible. It's different private houses here to so I can't complain to the housing.Hi I have a 6 yr old son. He is very friendly and will play with kids of most ages.

Emm37hsy,"Hi, 
DD is being bullied and laughed at at school. According to DD this happens because she won't go to school in make up that isn't allowed. (some make up is but she won't even wear that) She doesn't wear a skirt that shows her knickers. All of this means that people don't like DD and refuse to be her friends as they will be deemed &#034;weird&#034;. 

DD has dyspraxia meaning some work can be hard. she is allowed the use of a laptop but won't use it as people want to know why and she won't tell them so they laugh and call her names. 

All this came to a head when the HOY phoned to tell me DD sits on her own at breaks and lunch. he has not once seen her with other children. when i spoke to DD she just broke down into tears.

My daughter, aged 6, in Y1 at primary school, hasn't been enjoying classes as she did last year in reception. Her work has improved so there isn't doubts about the teacher's lessons. Sorry if I'm not making much sense. I have really tried hard liking this Y1 teacher, to where it's been a struggle. It's not just me but daughter's dad find this teacher very rude. 

I'm not imagining things but I feel this teacher is picking on me. I mentioned this to my dp and he complained in writing to the school, which was dealt with. Yet the teacher's got this attitude problem with me. I haven't done anything wrong to her. She blanks me when I speak to her sometimes. She talks down to me as if I'm a naughty schoolgirl. She's always making me wait until I'm the last parent standing at home time before she tells daughter to go to me. She avoided a parents evening meeting with me once. She once lied to me about something serious and tried scaring me into accepting something, when I later found out a parent has rights. 

Recently I've had cancer and this teacher knew this. She has never asked how I am. When I spent time away in hospital, my dp had to take our daughter to school when he discovered how unfriendly that teacher was. He told me that she was moaning at him for forgetting to bring back our dd's homework, and he explained that it's a difficult time because daughter's mum (me) has cancer. The teacher walked away.

According to the school, this teacher is &#034;fantastic&#034;. I've tried hard to like this woman but she's always making me feel uncomfortable and upset. I just don't like her. I overheard one of the mum's saying how &#034;nice&#034; this teacher was (her daughter is in my daughter's class). So I know she's picking on me. We've complained twice about her now and I once asked for my daughter to be placed in a different room but it's getting to be too late as it's halfway. I feel like complaining again as she ignored me last week and acted like I wasn't there on purpose. What would you do?I wasn't sure where to post this under.

Alexis B(19),"I am sorry this iv very long...this is about a good friend of mine, well the situation is little bit complicated, but her lil boy ( 7yrs) has had a good friendship with one certain child (7.5yrs old) they met at a baby group bout 7yrs ago and they are in the same class. This other child has always had jealousy issues and wouldnt like my friend's lil boy to make new friends as hed pull him away and call him names, this got worse since they started school 3years ago, the bullying continues as my friend's child is just an easy going lil boy who makes friends very easily, he made new friends at school and that other boy didnt like it at all. so hed push,hit, pull call names to my friend's lil boy when he didnt want to play with him. my friend was also a good friend of this boy's mother, they have tried to resolve the issues of her son bullying and be horrible to my friend's child, sometimes it worked sometimes it didnt.

This woman's partner ended their relationship as she became very unstable as she would check on his fb profile and send horrible messages to any female friends he has especially if theyd gone out. this woman confided in my friend about this and my friend did everything she could to try and help her, but sometimes it was difficulty because she would make horrible comments and stuff. 

My friends has recently started university and things are going well for her...for a change as she hasnt had it easy at all. This friend started complaining how she was lonely and stuff and would say to my friend oh now you are going to uni you dont know what its like to be alone because you and your child have social life and i don, bearing in mind that my friend doesnt have any family around its just her and her lil boy, but this woman has her whole family around.
My friend would get upset because this supposedly friend started being really funny with her and making comments like oh now you wont want to hang out with me because you will be with your new friends from uni.

Her son has never been invited to play dates whereas my friend's child has had plenty of playdates and this friend would say oh i wish it was my child being invited and stuff...anyway..they went out for meal just before chirstmas and this lady got so drunk and men were just grabbing her and stuff, and she would do the same to men, my friend had to drag this woman home and made sure that she was safe, even though she would call my friend horrible names when she was *drunk*..my friend was just concerned about her welfare. They have been out lots of times and my friend is always the one who brings this lady home when she was drunk and stuff and always made sure she was safe .

Since July last year this lady has been inviting random men to her house for sex even though she has two young children in the house, she would befriend them on facebook then invite them for sex, my friend adviced this lady that she was putting herself and her children's life at risk by inviting random men around to her house, so she had told this lady that if she continues she was goin to tell her mum and her youngest child's father about random men coming to the house, but my friend never told anyone she thot saying this would make her stop inviting random men around for sex. 

Few months ago the bullyin from her child to my friend's child continued they talked about the issue but was not going anyway so my friend distanced herself from that woman for few weeks. My friend went and have a word with the school regarding the issue, then her lil boy asked her one day why that particualr boy was always mean to him and calls him names when he doesnt want to play with him especially when he has not done anything wrong and he was really upset and that was unlike him as he has never asked this before. So my friend sent the boys mother text explaining what her son had said, then my friend made it clear that she had explain to her son that his supposedly friend was bullying him and that she would do everything she could to protect him. my friend's son's bday was in early March and she didnt want to have a party but just a meal out and cinema. so my firend wrote on fb tht she was glad that her son didnt want to have a party so theyl be going to the cinema and meal. 

Then out of the blue this lady text her asking why she wasnt having a party for her son, so she told her that they wanted to do something different for a change, then this lady text saying &#034;oh well if you are going to the cinema and meal i wont be able to come because its expensive,..blah blah&#034;..so my friend replied saying well this was only for her child and other two close friends. Then this lady sent loads of messages saying to my friend &#034; you are a very selfish person for expecting parents to pay fo themselves and their children when going for a meal for your son's bday. So my friend text back sayin she didnt have to come if she couldnt afford it..then more horrible messages from tht lady to my friend sayin that my friend was an f^$^% B$%^&amp; and that she need to go back to her country, to her dirty and poor country where she belongs because noone here wants her and that she sticks out like a sore thumb and that she need to go back and that eveyone thinks the same they just dont tell her..so my friend was really shocked and very upset. 

My friend text this lady asking her why she had sent her nasty messages and stuff, but more horrible messages kept coming saying how selfish and stupid my friend was for not wanting to have a party for her son and that she doesnt belong in this country and that if she was in politics shed make sure that she got send back to where she came from and that she looks like a baboon who eats off the ground...two weeks later my friend saw this lady's mother and said hi to her and the lady's mum looked at my friend as if she was dirty and looked away..they used to talk, ..my friend still dont understand what she has done wrong. Cant repeat some of the vile text from this lady to my friend as they are extremely nasty and racist.

 But guessing from what this lady did when her last partner ended their relationship everything made sense but my friend is still hurting that someone she considered a friend would one day tell her to go back where she f5%$^ belong. This lady told her family that her ex used to beat her up and forced her to have sex but he never did all these things that this lady said he did ..so now her family do not talk to her ex even tho hes the father of her youngest, shes lied to *punish him*..and she told my friend that shel make sure he will pay for dumping her and clearly told her that she had lied to her family about him beating her up and stuff, infact it was the other way round, she has a ragin violent temper and exteremely jealousy...my friend told her that she was being selfish and need to tell her family the truth , but now she has made sure that her family never speaks to her ex they will never know the whole truth. 

So we both thinks she has done the same about my friend and told her family loads of lies, my friend was godmother to her youngest, she has cooked for them, cleaned and helped her out everytime but this lady never returned any favour. 

How can i help my friend move on and forget about this lady, she sometimes says shes ok, but i can see that she is still hurting even though this happened early February.I am sorry this iv very  long...this is about a good friend of mine, well the situation is little bit complicated, but her lil boy ( 7yrs)  has had a good friendship with one certain child (7.5yrs old)  they met at a baby group bout 7yrs ago and they are in the same class.

They have been out lots of times and my friend is always the one who brings this lady home when she was drunk and stuff and always made sure she was safe .Since July last year this lady has been inviting random men to her house for sex even though she has two young children in the house, she would befriend them on facebook then invite them  for sex, my friend adviced  this lady that she was putting herself and her children's life at risk by inviting random men around to her house, so she had told this lady that if she continues she was goin to tell her mum and  her youngest child's father about random men coming to the house, but my friend never told anyone she thot saying this would make her stop inviting random men around for sex. Few months ago the bullyin from her child to my friend's child continued they talked about the issue but was not going anyway so my friend distanced herself from that woman for few weeks.  My friend went and have a word with the school regarding the issue, then her lil boy asked her one day why that particualr boy was always mean to him and calls him names when he doesnt want to play with him especially when he has not done anything wrong and he was really upset and that was unlike him as he has never asked this before. So my friend sent the boys mother text explaining what her son had said, then my friend made it clear that she had explain to her son that his supposedly friend was bullying him and that she would do everything she could to protect him. my friend's son's bday was in early March and she didnt want to have a party but just a meal out and cinema. so my firend wrote on fb tht she was glad that her son didnt want to have a party so theyl be going to the cinema and meal. Then out of the blue this lady text her asking why she wasnt having a party for her son, so she told her that they wanted to do something different for a change, then this lady text saying ""oh well if you are going to the cinema and meal i wont be able to come because its expensive,..blah blah""..so my friend replied saying well this was only for her child and other two close friends. Then this lady sent loads of messages  saying to my friend "" you are a very  selfish person for expecting parents to pay fo themselves and their children when going for a meal for your son's bday. So my friend text back sayin she didnt have to come if she couldnt afford it..then more horrible messages from tht lady to my friend sayin that my friend was an f^$^% B$%^& and that she need to go back to her country, to her dirty and poor country where she belongs because noone here wants her and that she sticks out like a sore thumb and that she need to go back and that eveyone thinks the same  they just dont tell her..so my friend was really shocked and very upset. My friend text this lady asking her why she had sent her nasty messages and stuff, but more horrible messages kept coming saying how selfish and stupid my friend was for not wanting to have a party for her son and that she doesnt belong in this country and  that if she was in politics shed make sure that she got send back to where she came from and that she looks like a baboon  who eats off the ground...two weeks later my friend saw this lady's mother and said hi to her and the lady's mum looked at my friend as if she was dirty and looked away..they used to talk, ..my friend still dont understand what she has done wrong. Cant repeat some of the vile text from this lady to my friend as they are extremely nasty and racist. But guessing from what this lady did when her last partner ended their relationship everything made sense but  my friend is still hurting that someone she considered a friend would one day tell her to go back where she f5%$^ belong. This lady told her family that her ex used to beat her up and forced her to have sex but he never did all these things that this lady said he did ..so now her family do not talk to her ex even tho hes the father of her youngest, shes lied to *punish him*..and she told my friend that shel make sure he will pay for dumping her and clearly told her that she had lied to her family about him beating her up and stuff, infact it was the other way round, she has a ragin violent temper and exteremely jealousy...my friend told her that she was being selfish and need to tell her family the truth , but now she has made sure that her family never speaks to her ex they will never know the whole truth. So we both thinks she has done the same about my friend and told her family loads of lies, my friend was godmother to her youngest, she has cooked for them, cleaned and helped her out everytime but this lady never returned any favour. How can i help my friend  move on and forget about this lady, she sometimes says shes ok, but i can see that she is still hurting even though this happened early February.",1,"1,360", 22-03-2013 at 10.44PM  
Cla11tni,"So hubby did the school run this morning and was waiting outside the reception doors when a yr 1 boy came up to ds and asked him &#034;you support Liverpool don't you?&#034; to which my son happily yes, the boy then commented &#034;your dad's from Liverpool isn't he?&#034; and again ds just replied yes, the boy then proceeded to laugh and say to my son &#034;yeah you're a bin dipper, you scousers can't afford proper food so you have to dip in bins, you smelly bin dipper&#034;!!!!!!!!! :shock:

Hubby was so shocked that he just told the boy to go away and get back to his own class line. then he became fuming over the comment as it had really upset ds, he's a mild mannered child and he thinks a lot and I know this will play on his mind today. Hubby looked for the boy's dad as they are familiar with each other but he couldn't see him, just the mother who he doesn't know

Hubby went home to cool down but has now decided to go back to the school and complain

this is the first time we've ever encountered any bullying and I want this nipped in the bud, and not sure how best to deal with it. so any advice would be much appreciated

I just can not believe something so nasty could come out of a 6yr olds mouth, but then he's only got it from his parents!!

ang05eji,"Hello all,
i,m looking for a way to get through what i feel to be a disgraceful situation.
My lovely 4 year old has started reception and is getting hit in the chest and head by some of the other kids there. At various times and there seems to be no apparent trend to it&gt;&gt;
I have mentioned to the teacher my concerns and that i will not tolerate physical violence towards my son and i felt i was being listened to and they/she adviced me that it would stop. 
Well it transpires it hasn,t as my child is still reporting he is being hit .
I get the feeling that thjis sort of issue ie hitting kids, is basically accepted as the norm by the slack approach of the teacher.?
Whilst i don,t want to go in there all guns blazing i feel both me and my son are being let down and failed by what i expected to be a happy time , going to school.
It feels like i am not being heard ? Do i have to go to the head ? Report it to Ofsted?
I expected a verbal chat to suffice to say that as a parent i do not want my son hit, i more than anyone know of the implications of being hit , as i was badly bullied at school and at home !
I feel at a loss as to what my next move is , so far i ,ve been assured that the kids are dealt withb and punished with cloudy chair episodes&lt;&lt;
i,m also conscious that i dont want to give my son an identity of being bullied as this in itself creates ahavoc with kids measurement of themselves , eg lowers their confidence , 
Any suggestions please , as i move into battle? Is this bullying or part of the behaviour on some childrens part , and not particularly aimed at my son ,,:confused:Hello all,i,m looking for a way to get through what i feel to be a disgraceful situation.My lovely 4 year old has started reception and is getting hit in the chest and head by some of the other kids there.

Mai60pwt,"My 4 ½ started school in September. Ever since he started a boy in another class has been pushing him around in the playground. I spoke to the teachers and they said that it won't happen again. I know from other mums that this boy has been hurting a lot of boys and no one listens. My little boy comes home almost every day in tears and with some sort of scrape. He does not like going to school and will use any excuse to stay at home. I am at my wits end as the school doesn’t seem to care and just want to hide it. I am worried about my boy who has become withdrawn and is not doing well at school. We never experienced this problem with my elder boy but now they have a new headmistress. Please can anyone give me some advice on how I can help my little boy?

My dd on one occasion got kicked and hit, another occasion got told they r smarter than her, they boss her around, took money off her and yesterday a girl nipped her. 
Now my dd for some reason wont tell her teachers. She just takes it and wont stick up for herself. She even now gets into trouble for things she hasnt done and wont even tell the teacher it wasnt her. Iv approached the teachers 3 times so far. Last week i approached them to say that my dd is scared to speak to them so they spoke to her and told her she can talk to them. So Yesterday my dd got her pencil took off her and nipped by one of the girls so my dd went to tell her teacher, her teacher replied with aw a dont want to hear it!
I was fuming so went to the deputy head today who was lovely. She will speak to my girl and try and sort this.
Im really struggling cause i just want to make it go away. Shes such a lovely natured girl, sensitive, kind and just doesnt understand whats going on. She now doesnt want to go to school some days and it breaks my heart.
I try talking to her and yesterday she said it makes her sad. I do a wee game where she writes things down that happened in school that made her happy, sad, fun and bad. Hoping that encourages her to talk.

Deleted profile,"My 6 year old son had his PE top physically and aggressively taken off of him, by the deputy head of his school, during a PE lesson and made to continue the lesson topless. All because he was putting his knees inside his top!

This happened on Wednesday and I did not find this out until Thursday when collecting him. I called Ofsted, the children's safeguarding board and the police for some advice before speaking to the head on Friday. All the authorities were very interested, but told me to follow the correct procedure and if I was not happy to get back to them.

I saw the head who was incredibly understanding and did not at any time try to make any excuses! When this was brought to her attention, she did question the teacher. It has now come to light he has lied about some of the events, like saying he told my son &#034;Give that here&#034; (about the top) instead of admitting he removed it! His excuse was, he was dealing with another issue and my son was playing with his top and &#034;It's like when someone constantly taps a pen, and you tell them to stop, but they don't, so you just take the pen off them!&#034;

It has been confirmed by several other children that in fact the teacher removed the top! When I saw the head I said I wanted him investigating by an outside body (Local Safeguarding Children's Board), and an apology to myself and my son, in writing and in person, also a record of concern to be put against his file. For my child to never be in a class with him, or alone with him.

When I left, I still felt sick! Upon reflection, I actually want to take this all the way and have his job! He is a DEPUTY HEAD! Other teachers look up to this man for guidance and he actually removed an item of clothing from a child and made him do a lesson topless!!!!

If this was YOUR child... Not asking if you would &#034;kill&#034; him because obviously I want to batter him, but realistically, what would you be seeking? For him to lose his job? Just an apology? 

I guess I just want a feel for if I am over reacting, obviously this is my son so I could well be over thinking it, don't get me wrong I will still be continuing my formal complaint...

My 8 year old son is becoming more and more scared everyday because of a bully assaulting him. The violence used to be a once a fortnight, then week now it's everyday. He is at school and lives in the same street as the &#034;bully&#034;. And he will not hit back as it is not in his nature (not promising he won't). The violence started as a punch, a bite or a push, to being pushed down the stairs also threatened and chased by the bully who was holding a 3ft 2&#034;diameter stick as a weapon. 

The &#034;bully&#034; is only a 6 year old girl, although she is big for her age (the same size as my 8 year old son) shows this kind of behaviour to at least 4 other children. She struggles with telling the truth (silly tales) and steals from other children and the teachers. The school have arranged a psychologist to see her but her mother is Reluctant. In the teacher of 15 years words &#034;this is the worst case she has ever seen!&#034; And the school have her on a behaviour chart. 

I tried my best to stay friendly with the other child's mother, but she can't see past herself, she is quite selfish when it comes to parenting, works 16 hours a week, but has tax payers keeping her 2 children in private childcare 45 hours a week mon - fri. Friday - Sunday the kids are off to the grandparents house. She is a single mother and blames the absent father for this problem, she thinks that the dad should &#034;fix&#034; their daughter (the mothers words). Although she has not allowed the dad contact with theyre kids for over a year now (as he wanted to introduce them to his new partner). She also believes that her child's reasons for violence are valid ie being provoked in a game of rig by being tagged! I have ran out of patience being nice, as its getting my son nowhere. She would rather put all her attention onto her latest boyfriend. And I am very very irate by this situation. 

I have enrolled my children in a new school, but unfortunately they cannot start until August. And the way things are financially we do not have the funds to move home. I have contacted the school, the education board of the council, parent line. The incident with the 3ft stick was only today but I'm so disgusted by that I intend on contacting the family liaison officers of the police force. 

The parents of the other children have also tried talking to the mum, but no progress. 

Would really appreciate any advice or similar experiences. I'm terrified for my son that things will get even worse. I'm struggling to sleep concentrate, or stop worrying as is my son. 
I'm also struggling to keep my cool with the mother. Have exchanged unpleasantries but nothing heated.

Hel76eqd,"Just found out all my daughters old friends have formed a circle and she is excluded.
She is a very bright child,whois also very pretty and sporty too.(dont mean to sound big headed!).
She works hard at school and is well thought of by teachers and other parents.
This is a recent issue.Probably started after christmas break.
Her and another girl who has also been excluded met at local park yesterday.
My daughter informed me this morning that the group of girls were calling her ugly etc.
 
The ring leader is a strong character and i think some of the other girls are scared of her.
On the way to school my daughter asked if i could speak to her teacher about the bullying.
Unfortunately my daughter sits next to the ring leader in school.It sounds like it is also going on during break times too.
What do i do.I know that sometimes talking to teacher will make it worse for the victim.But i want to sort it out now before it escalates.
Many Thanks.G.G.Just found out all my daughters old friends have formed a circle and she is excluded.She is a very bright child,whois also very pretty and sporty too.(dont mean to sound big headed!).She works hard at school and is well thought of by teachers and other parents.This is a recent issue.Probably started after christmas break.Her and another girl who has also been excluded met at local park yesterday.My daughter informed me this morning that the group of girls were calling her ugly etc. The ring leader is a strong character and i think some of the other girls are scared of her.On the way to school my daughter asked if i could speak to her teacher about the bullying.Unfortunately my daughter sits next to the ring leader in school.It sounds like it is also going on during break times too.What do i do.I know that sometimes talking to teacher will make it worse for the victim.But i want to sort it out now before it escalates.Many Thanks.G.G.",2,"3,443", 29-01-2013 at 11.15AM  
Ali46uer,"My 11yr old daughter is being verbally bullied by a boy in the same year as her. He has already been excluded from school 4 times since september, the things he says to her are almost pornographic, he has also threatened her with violence, she couldn't even go into the dining hall for dinner yesterday because of fear of him being there, she had to get her friends to take her some dinner to her in the playground. 
The school know his history and he is already on a red card, but he gets sent to the quiet room at breaks and lunchtime and for some lessons, this i don't feel is enough !!!! i think he sees this as being let off lessons. 
The headteacher is totally useless, he has never met with me or my daughter he always deligates it to his deputys and heads of college. 
I have been told that if he has a problem then the school would be getting extra money for having him there, which is wrong on so many levels !!!!!!
I don't know what else to do, i've been into school, i've rung school but the so called punishment to this lad is the same. He needs permanently excluding and possibly put in a special facility.

 Since going back, there is now an issue with 3 girls in her form who are making life hell for her, saying she smells, laughing at her, and spreading romours about her to the other girls in her form.
 She goes to an all girls school which i thought was a good decision at the time, but is very ****** and the classmates are all very judgemental on looks, what eachother wears etc. My daughter is a bit over weight, but has done really well on a healthy eating diet and lose a few stone in weight, but she still feels she does not fit in and is very shy. Because of this, i think she is targeted. 
 Both my husband and myself have spoken to the school and they have had a word with the girls, but since then it has got worse, and on several occasions my daughter has walked out of school in tears and come home. 
 This morning, the school assured us it had been sorted...my daughter was only in school half an hour and all of her form had been gossiping and when she came in were laughing and talking about her. She then walked out again and came home.
 We have told the school she wanted to change forms as her friends are in a different form, but because of her gcse's next year, they are not keen to do this. They are more concerned about her attendance then getting to the bottom of it.

reb44vgh,"Bit of a long story as its been going on for a while but will try to keep it as short as possible as I could really do with some advice.

DS is 7 and in year 2. Since starting in reception he has had a constant &#034;best friend&#034; and I am good friends with the childs mum.

However, from quite early on it was obvious that the best friend is quite physical (watches ALOT of action films, super hero things &amp; x-box games), is quite bossy and the leader of the pack (there are usually 4 others in the gang along with DS), DS on the other hand is very sensitive and does what he is told!

DS goes through stages of being very unhappy saying that the &#034;best friend&#034; hits him, pushes him around and makes him play games he doesnt want to. I know when he is being picked on because his behavior at home changes, he is very aurgumentative(sp?), picks on his younger sister and gets into tantrums/crying spells and at the weekend he got very upset said he didnt want to go to school and said he wanted to kill himself (this really freaked me out where on earth would he have heard this kind of talk from?). Also he has picked up some unsavoury language from said friend the other day he called our dog a little f***er:shock:

In the past I have tried to talk to my friend but she just can not see its her son and blames the other boys in the gang, even though when we come out of school the boy is pushing my son around, grabbing him by the coat, spinning him around etc my friend doesnt say much:dunno:. The teachers are pretty useless too they just say the know nothing about it (which they wouldnt as this goes on in lunch time when they are in the staff room and the playground assistants seem oblivious to it!).

Now on the other hand I do accept that my son is very sensitive, DH says he should hit him back as he always did an no-one ever picked on him. My mum &amp; dad say perhaps Karate lessons may help him. I just dont know I am wondering if it would be better for me to find some assertiveness classes for him because he is more than likely to come across other boys like this in the future and surely its more important to be able to stand up to these kind of people and have the confidence to say no and to walk away.

I'm just at a bit of a loss but want to nip this in the bud before it turns into full-blown bullying which I really beleive it will if this boy sees he can manipulte my son:(Bit of a long story as its been going on for a while but will try to keep it as short as possible as I could really do with some advice.DS is 7 and in year 2.  Since starting in reception he has had a constant ""best friend"" and I am good friends with the childs mum.However, from quite early on it was obvious that the best friend is quite physical (watches ALOT of action films, super hero things & x-box games), is quite bossy and the leader of the pack (there are usually 4 others in the gang along with DS), DS on the other hand is very sensitive and does what he is told!DS goes through stages of being very unhappy saying that the ""best friend"" hits him, pushes him around and makes him play games he doesnt want to.  I know when he is being picked on because his behavior at home changes, he is very aurgumentative(sp?), picks on his younger sister and gets into tantrums/crying spells and at the weekend he got very upset said he didnt want to go to school and said he wanted to kill himself (this really freaked me out where on earth would he have heard this kind of talk from?).  Also he has picked up some unsavoury language from said friend the other day he called our dog a little f***er:shock:In the past I have tried to talk to my friend but she just can not see its her son and blames the other boys in the gang, even though when we come out of school the boy is pushing my son around, grabbing him by the coat, spinning him around etc my friend doesnt say much:dunno:.  The teachers are pretty useless too they just say the know nothing about it (which they wouldnt as this goes on in lunch time when they are in the staff room and the playground assistants seem oblivious to it!).Now on the other hand I do accept that my son is very sensitive, DH says he should hit him back as he always did an no-one ever picked on him.  My mum & dad say perhaps Karate lessons may help him.  I just dont know I am wondering if it would be better for me to find some assertiveness classes for him because he is more than likely to come across other boys like this in the future and surely its more important to be able to stand up to these kind of people and have the confidence to say no and to walk away.I'm just at a bit of a loss but want to nip this in the bud before it turns into full-blown bullying which I really beleive it will if this boy sees he can manipulte my son:(",4,"2,930", 24-01-2013 at 10.20AM  
Joanne G(561),"My DS started foundation this September and at first this was an exciting experience for him. As time has gone on, a boy in his class (a very troubled child who is involved with social services and a whole catolougue of home issues) has been picking on my son (and also other children in the class). I have witnessed the boy show aggression to other children in the class (lashing out with punches and teasing without provacation). 
My son has come home on numerous occasions saying that this boy has upset him. Knowing the boys background, I have told my son to tell the teacher if this boy upsets him and to also keep away from him if he can. My son is a very quiet, gentle boy that does not like confrontation and since the start of school we have noticed a change in him. (my older DS experienced changes when he first started school but he soon settled in after a couple of weeks so I don't feel it's early in the year nerves). He has started wetting the bed at night (something that hasn't happened for over two years), he has become very emotional-crying over the slightest thing (once because his baby sister was looking at him!) and also not wanting to go to school in the mornings. 
Today he came home from school and was quite upset because this 'boy' had tried to strangle him. He said he was crying and said that he told the 'teacher' (his class teaching assistant). I immediatly phoned the teacher to voice my concerns about this child and my worry that he can cause serious damage to my child. (Earlier in the week I asked the teacher if everything was ok in class because my son had started to wet the bed and she said yes). She said she was not aware of the strangling incident and was surprised it had happened. I told her the name of the teaching assistant who was involved and she said she will speak to her and me after the half term. I feel that the school should have informed me of an incident where another child has tried to strangle my son. A bit of pushing or hitting would be forgivable and not something I would worry about but to think that this boy has put his hands around my sons neck makes me sick to my stomach and basically would like some advice on how far to take this situation. Changing class isn't an option as there is only one class per year, could change schools but his older brother is in year 2 at the same school and I just want him to be his happy go lucky self again and not having this distress at only four years old.

Katie N(110),"Hey :hiya:

I have never posted on netmums before, and i have a bit of a dilemma. My 7yo daughter has been bullied since the day she started school in reception 3 years ago. She spent 2 years at one school, where a boy would severely bully her, things like headbutting, biting, punching, hair pulling, strangling ect ect. After 2 years of fighting with the school for some kind of help and trying but failing to contact the school goveners, i moved her schools in September of this year. Its a very small catholic school, no more than 200 pupils in total, not my first choice but it was the only school who could take her ( it took me 3 months to get the place there ).
 Although she was bullied at her old school, she did have a good group of friends there but since starting her new school she has struggled to make friends and feels extremely left out. Nobody in her class will play with her, My daughter says she has heard them saying they dont like her. She has nobody to play with at break times and nobody will work with her in the classroom.
 I dont understand why this is happening. She is pretty, blonde haired and blue eyed, she is clean and well presented ( never in a dirty uniform ), extremely polite, kind and caring, she is not fat, she doesnt have glasses. Nothing that children would normally bully each other about. 
 This is actually breaking my heart, i feel so bad for her :'(

Joanne G(561),"This will probaly be very long winded so apoligies. 
It all started with my 4 yr old DS being bullied by a classmate earlier in the year (puched, kicked and strangled!) which I have made a post about &amp; received great advice!). 

So it came to a point where I confronted the teacher regarding the boy who was bullying my son. She was completly in denial but said she'd monitor. She then phoned me later that day and said that a TA did witness this boy hitting my son without being provoked. She said she'd speak to them both and monitor them closely. 
The next week on the day she was away my DS came home because he said this boy put paint on his nose. (he said he couldn't tell his teacher because she wasn't there-I guess he wasn't comfortable telling anyone else.) I informed her the next morning and she just brushed it off. Another incident after that was my son upset because the other boy had lied to the teacher to get my son in trouble-I asked her but she turned it around and said she had to tell my son off for being mean to the other boy and that my son was obviously not used to be told off as he's not normally naughty) 

Later that week this other boy received 'head teacher award' on the Friday (not his first!). The following week my son again was crying one evening because he said this boy hit him in the eye with his bag while he was putting his shoes on. He was also begging to move to another school. This was the final straw. I spoke to his teacher the next morning and she said a member of staff witnessed the incident and it was an accident. I said I wanted to meet with the head because my son is so unhappy and is begging to move to another school. (even though my DS has an older brother in yr 2 he said he doesn't care he just wants to get away from this boy and he hates school). During the meeting with the head, I said my concerns about this boy and meanwhile my sons teacher was defending this other boy no end. The head said that if I wanted to move my son to another school then that's my choice. I said it's not what I want to do as my older DS is doing so well at that school that I want my younger DS to follow in his footsteps. (My older DS was also bullied in this teachers foundation class when he was there but as soon as we complained it was stopped). The conclusion was that the teacher would continue to monitor the situation and would write positive things in my sons diary that we could focus on in the evenings so that my son could focus on things that make him happy at school. 

So on Friday, I collect DS and before we are even out the gates, he bursts into tears. (DS is a sensitive boy but these constant tears never happened until he started foundation). I asked him what was wrong and he said this other boy had been given head teachers award again. (this is about the 5 or 6 time-my son has only had it once and he asked me why? I told him to ask his teacher why and so he did. Her reply was that everyone has to have a turn which is fair enough). So I immediatly took my crying son back to his class and told him to tell his teacher why he was crying. (I wanted her to see how upset he was as she told the headteacher that my son is always happy at school and must only get upset when he gets home-she even said that my son tries to play with other boy and I told her that's what happens when a child is bullied-they crave their attention!). So she tells my son that she didn't give the headteacher award to other boy but it was given by the year 6 children for his help with cleaning away toys and that if my son wasn't so busy having fun then he might get it too!. She then walked away! Both my DS's said that she was wrong and it was her that gave him the award. Even if she didn't, she had previously told my son that the awards were given out so that everyone has a turn. (clearly not the case as my son has had it once and the other boy has had it many-very confusing for 4 year old.) 
We got home and my sons school report was in his bag with some 'steps' to work towards. (ie: ask questions, express feelings and build confidence) Parents then had to leave their comments. I described the latest incident and said how can my son acheive these steps when the teacher does that? I havn't eaten or slept for three days because I'm so worked up. The teacher was away today so she's yet to see my comments, and I've just found out she's the deputy head! I really don't want to make a fuss but as they asked for my comments I wasn't going to lie! I now think that the bully was not solely the problem but the way the teacher treats him (she even has an a4 photo of the bully and none of the other children on the wall).

cheryl g(3),"Just wondering what your definition of bullying was? Hubby and I have slightly differing views on this but it is an issue with our dd at the moment so thought I would get others' views on it. 

On one hand hubby believes that bullying is any name calling etc but I think it has to be consistent name calling. I know bullying is a VERY serious issue and unfortunately we are now both under the impression our daughter is being bullied. I have spoken to her class teacher this morning and we are going to meet with her tonight but I am still reluctant to use the word 'bullying' as it is such a strong word. They are also still young so I am unsure whether they are capable of bullying just yet and whether it is 'just' name calling. They are 7/8. Obviously either way we need it to be nipped in the bud as soon as possible. I don't suppose on the whole it matters what word we use but I am interested to hear what others think.Just wondering what your definition of bullying was?

Deleted profile,"My DD aged 6 has been bullied at her independent girls' school for months. 
I have followed all the steps recommended by the various links on this site.
The principal of the junior school saw it fit to humiliate her in front of her class, told my DD she is lying (even though the bully has changed her story about 10 times and is the obvious liar), then did not get back to me to follow up. 
Teacher pretended not to know what I was on about! After a week of talking about the problem.
Now, thanks to the teachers' unwillingness to investigate properly, every single child has turned against my child. 
She was submitted to verbal and physical abuse in front of the teachers today. Chlildren mocked her when she started crying, and called her a 'dweeb' and a 'loser'! So much for the posters of 'It's ok to tell' on the walls...
I am so disgusted that professional people can be so mean and heartless to a little child. 
Why can't they help the other children not to be prejudiced? To have compassion for others! 
Absolutely gutted about this situation. At home time, teacher would not make eye contact with me and other parents all smirking. 
Well, in my family, we value honesty and hard work. So they can be as smug as they like - we know what really happened. And Kharma, as they say, can be a *****.
I know I now have to take it up with the next level of authority, but I know it is a futile excercise. So sad.

Lau73cex,"Hi in september i changed my two childrens school as i had issues with my youngest's teacher, i felt i was getting no where by going to the head teacher or the education authority, so i made the hard dissision of moving them. 
My oldest (10) loved his old school was doing really well in his work, had many friends, never missed a day off. Since moving he has gone down hill, hates school, wont do his work or reading, i was gettin rather concerned, he came home yesterday and broke down, he was a mess, told me hes been bullied since starting there, not physically but mentally and fowl mouthed with it, its been going on for 3 months, he doesnt want me to see the head teacher as the children will beat him up!!!!. He has told his teacher but she wont do anything, tells them to stop it but that makes it worse.
My daughter has improved in her work and her confidence since changing school, but says she gets bullied sometimes and the teacher does nothing about it. I cant send them to different schools.

Louise P(843),"My 5 year old DS is in year 1. He only started at this school September just gone as we moved home. Up until now he has settled in really well and his teacher says he is a delight to teach and has been making friends. Now Friday last week he seemed to come home in a funny/out of sorts kind of mood. 

He is normally a chatterbox and hardly ever sits down, but since Friday he has hardly been talking and when he does he is either hiding his mouth behind his hand or speaking in this whine/upset tone. He hasn't been as active as normal and has become quite clingy when at home with me and seems now to get upset or start to cry over nothing. He is also ignoring me although i know he hears me and is doing things he knows he is not meant to. 

He isn't putting up a fight about going to school in fact he seems happy to go he is just a lot quieter. I have spoken to his teacher and she has said she has not seen anything to indicate my DS is having problems with any of his classmates. Could something be going on in the playground between him and a child from a different class? Or am i overreacting to a 5 year old seeing if he can push the boundaries?My 5 year old DS is in year 1.

sorry to just upload all this on here but i really am at my witts end, let alone scared to let my son out to play

story is as follows
my son age 12, has his bike stolen from him by a well known bully round here 2 yrs older than my son, bully denies it to police, continues to threaten my son.

another 2 boys, tonight, also older than my son, one gripped my sons arms behind his back while the other rode off with my sons scooter. my son ran after them and asked for it back, they said ok if you give us £5 tomorrow at school. my son agreed, knowing he hasnt got £5, he rode off saying your not getting it. The boys chased him. he hid in a garden but was found by the boys, they said he is going to get beaten at school tomorrow, by a gang of them.

My son is now scared to go school tomorrow, lucky for him hes got an appointment in the morning. thing is the lad doing the threatening is well known for not giving a toss about anything, even the boys parents have bottled people in the street through disputes, even punching a 17 yr old in the face.

if i tell school then i risk making things worse for my son, same applies if i tell the police...but then i risk the whole family getting hurt, i have 3 other children. im so scared. im upset, im lost. i feel so bad for my son. 

He has just been diagnosed with some form of adhd, and hes small for 12, more age 8 size, we moved from a different area, so have no connections here, so its continuos taunting for him

any advice on what to do pls

he is being bullied often by people he know from school or in his class:shock: They call him names.. freak, geek,weird or making rude gestures to him over and over again. at school these children also pick on him, they call him the sames names and isolate him, say he can play then say he can't.

I came across this last night and it absolutely broke my heart, I was in tears:


 Amanda Todd: Teenager commits suicide weeks after posting heartbreaking YouTube video detailing battle with cyber bullies - Mirror Online 

I can so relate to this girl, I was bullied relentlessly for being different, (mixed race, scary spice hair) it got so bad that when i was 16 we moved 10 miles away justto get away from all the crap. I literally couldn't walk down the street without getting punched, they'd write my name all over the park signs saying I was dead. They'd kick my front door in till there was foot marks all over the door. on Christmas Eve, they sent me a Christmas card telling me it would be my last:(. In a way I was so lucky that we didn't have Facebook then because I dread to think what they would have done, I am sure I would of ended up like Amanda Todd.

It really does break my heart that people think the only way out is to end their life.

Just left it as part of the learning process and told him he could play with (J) and of course she was his friend.

Then tonight he started talking about B again and at first he said she was friendly but then he told me that B had said was he a girl or a boy and then started saying to him &#034;you're a girl, you're a girl, you're a girl &#034; in a funny voice. (He has not been teased before like this and the impression he gave was of a teasing voice) I asked him what he did and he said that he told her he was not a girl he was a boy. I said Well done.

He then told me B had hit him and he shouted at her NO and the teacher told him well done for shouting (I think she must have been praising him for not hitting her back!

Should I just leave him to work it out. Is this just part of learning how to look after yourself (so young?) Or should i mention it to his teacher and ask her to keep an eye out.

Zan96gly,"Hello 

My daughter is 4 and started school recently with alot of the same children she went to preschool with. This halped with the transition and i thought she would be fine. 2 of the girls from her preschool formed a close bond with each other over the summer holidays and now my daughter has been coming home this past week saying one girl in particular shouting to her DONT FOLLOW ME and YOUR NOT MY BEST FRIEND and YOU CANT PLAY HERE.
 My daughter is the youngest in her class she is sensitive but confident but seems drawn to the louder girls who lead and dominate.
 i have spoken to the teacher who was extremely understanding and advised me that she had noticed the two girls taking control and do keep them apart. The teacher told me they would keep an extra eye on my daughter but she came home last night and told me that the same girl had hit her with a ruler,she went to tell a teacher but she didnt hear her.
 I am absolutely distraught i dont want my daughter to go to school and have to experience this kind of nastiness on a regular basis. But what more can i do? The problem is my daughter loves to play with these girls and would class them as her friends so i cant just tell her to play with someone else. i also think the majority of the time they play nicely.

Do i speak to the girls mother?
(who is known throughout the school and a volunteer on the PTA)
do i go back to the teacher?
am i over reacting?

i was bullied in primary school by the girl who was my best friend,,looking back i can see how manipulating and controlling my &#034;best friend&#034; was and i dont want my daughter to fall into this trap too.Hello My daughter is 4 and started school recently with alot of the same children she went to preschool with.

she67hdu,"Hi, 
I'm really hoping someone can give me some tips here...

I have two boys the eldest of whom is severely autistic and non verbal. The youngest (11) has suffered almost constant bullying both physical and verbal (kids saying here's the little spastic brother etc) and I've been into his primary school and dealt with other parents on numerous occasions.

As a result of this (I think) he now seems rather keen to kinda grab and hold onto friends and can seem quite possessive of them.
He's now started secondary and I'd already made them aware of issues we'd had at primary. There is one child, ironically supposedly one of his friends, who has started snubbing him at breaks and lunch and if he tries to talk to him he says he's a freak stalking him. Problem s now all of his old friends in his class are doing it and I just found out he spends his breaks and lunch wandering on his own so nobody can be horrible to him.

I have tried explaining to him that these people are not really hs friends but he seems so determined to hang onto the few that he has, that he will tolerate any behaviour. It almost seems like hed rather have people who treat him badly than nobody.

He has very low self esteem and says he hates his life. We were referred to cambs several years ago
Because he started saying he didn't want to live anymore. They suggested lots of different clubs etc like young careers but at the time he was so clingy nd wouldn't go anywhere without me and as I wasn't allowed to go yc they said they can't help him and discharged us.

He is also overweight but unfortunately the more down he goes the more he eats causing him to feel worse about himself so we are going round in circles

I keep trying to boost his confidence and am always telling him how great he is but I seem to be fighting a losing battle.

Sorry about the life story, but I have no sea where to go now :(((Hi, I'm really hoping someone can give me some tips here...I have two boys the eldest of whom is severely autistic and non verbal.

Emm12vhm,"I'm at my wits end... When my son started Reception last year another boy targeted him and we went backwards and forwards every day with it, he was kicked and punched and pushed over in the mud, he became withdrawn at home and began to wet himself again. Eventually it all came tumbling out of him when heartbreakingly he said to me 'where we're you today? I needed you and you weren't there' a little but if me died that day and since then I have kept an eagle eye on everything going on. Well, now we're in year one and the little group of boys in his class have shoved him and punched him in the stomach, at a child's birthday party on Saturday he was pushed to the floor by one of these boys after he had punched and kicked him and another one of them pushed him back to the floor when he tried to get up, this resulted in his head hitting the floor causing a massive swelling and a huge bruise, after taking him to the walk in it turns out that he was concussed and in a little bit of shock. I went to see the head today and she told me that there is no malice in it when you are five you just can't control yourself and that it's a good thing that my son bottles stuff up and doesn't tell me because it means that he's dealing with the ups and downs of life and friendship...

So what do I do now? Academically he's doing ok at school, he's part of the school council and has a nice small group of friends but these boys won't let up, he's in this class until he is 11 years old and I can just see it getting worse, do I pull out all the stops and call the school up on their anti-bullying policy or am I just being overprotective and the head is right?

I'm so confused, I feel like I'm failing him ",15,"2,054", 01-10-2012 at 11.40AM

per09kpf,"This afternoon I had a text message off my son; who had just finished school- that normally walks to and from his school with no problems. He had been hit- by another child and wanted me to collect him; but the circumstances have left me feeling so sad for him I could just sit here and cry. 

My son is 13, and has delayed mentaility, colour blindedness, speech difficulty, cannot write properly and reading is borderline. He also has a bone disorder in his legs. He has been withdrawn from foreign languages since yr 6, and there have been queries in him accessing the national curriculum least of all GCSEs when the time comes. When he was 10, I was told to expect him to be as good as it will get in terms of his learning- and his school at the time told me their concern now basically was to enable him to just simply read and write. 

His life has been a constant battle- more so with his education and those who work with him to understand his needs and abilities. Last year he started main stream high school (he has always been in main stream schools), and the issues I have had- have ranged from the following:

A child threatening him with a pair of scissors because he wanted my sons rubber
My son being punched in the genitals by other special needs children because they think it is funny
Name calling (gay, r*tard, stupid, idiot, thicko)- deliberatly making a mockery of his speech and the general way he is
Tormenting him over his bone condition- some days he needs splints, some days not. He has stopped using his splints and crutches even when he has been in pain because of the constant jibing. 
My son was playing snooker one day down in the pastoral area and as he bent down to take a shot accidently caught a child behind him with the que- my son apologised, but the other child still punched him in the side of the face
Another child- a girl his age- grabbed his arm, twisted it to friction burn and shoved it up his back so hard I had to come home from work early because it was so red and swollen the school werent sure if it needed hospital attention. 

I will point out, that at each time, this has been reported, documented and the children involved have been punished by the school etc. 
My son can be antagonistic, and occassionally says things he has no idea what they actually mean; today however, I have had to draw a line- and i genuinelly feel so heartbroken because he has done nothing but cry all afternoon and evening since. He has just gone up to bed and has just started crying again. 

Whilst in class early this morning, another child had been goading my son saying 'whats ya mum?' (the old- your mums a xyz cliche).. and my son ignored him.
This afternoon in last lesson before hometime, the same child and another child where in his maths class. The children sat in their usual places, and because the teacher felt the class wasn't paying attention, she swapped the seats of the class to make it more- interesting? I dont know. The child in question- was sat at the end of a row of tables near my son, and my son as he was colouring his units on his maths paper; openly said he was a 'gamer' (meaning computing, consoles, wii fanatic etc). 
Most of the class laughed he told me, and the child at the end of the row then said '** is gay' this is something he has been referred to before amongst other things. My son retaliated and caled him a r*tard to which the other child said 'whats your mum?' my son answered 'r*tard'. 
There has been controversy over this this afternoon as my son has been accused of calling this other childs mum r*tard- when in fact this &#034;whats your mum&#034; joke has been aimed at him since this morning. 

At this point, the child left his seat, approached my son and grabbed the back of his neck and went to punch him when the teacher intervened and sent the child out to calm down. The child came back in a few moments later, sat down and continued with his work. The bell went - the lesson finished, my son- on his own, walked across the school grounds- and as the children left numerous buildings my child was grabbed by the collar by one child and yanked back and another child who grabbed his arms; for the other angry child who was sent out of class earlier, to try to punch him in the chest- my son managed to turn away, only for this child to punch him in the eye. 

When I arrived at the school, the teacher in class amongst 5 other teachers- were sat with him; and my son is in floods- and i mean, floods of tears and was shaking. Not one person offered him a tissue untill i made a point of wiping his face on my sleeve several times. His teacher did say there was an ancident in class which she said she thought she had dealt with it and it was forgotten about. How wrong could she be and if a child is being so threatening like tht he should have been made to sit in the office untill his parents/whoever could collect him. 
The first aider had looked at my sons eye- and there was concern that the pupil did not respond to the torch light. His eye is very swollen, and has two very small (perhaps just smaller than half an inch) cuts at the corner of his eye/side just under the eye lashes. 

One of the pastoral teachers has taken a photo and was ringing the mum of the other child to explain he was suspended monday- but when he returned tuesday he would spend some time with him discussing behaviour and acting out psychically. What makes this worse, is this child is also special needs- and the majority of those who have bullied him in some way in the past - are either special needs or school action plus/ supported.

I feel devasted my son constantly seems to be bullied by other special needs children; who ridicule and humiliate my son- but if he so much as blinks at them in the wrong way he is penalised. Laughably, last year the school put all of their special needs children on an academic report/tracker; primarily because it failed its ofsted report- because their special needs children were under achieving- ? Im confused, I thought thats why thy were special needs because they under achive/ excessively over achieve because of their abilities!

So- to conclude, my son is either being penalised by the teachers for not writing legiably or could do better- but in the next breath gets a pasting off a group of kids because he is disabled? Its like my child deserves to have a kicking because of the way he is?? I feel like crying my eyes out- all my life has been an emotional struggle with a system who doesnt help him at all and constant bullying off anyone who thinks its funny to get a kick out of making fun of those disadvantaged. I would give my last breath for my son to be normal- yet I am sick of reporting the same of rubbish every day to the schools over the years. When are they going to start empowering children and explaining (not just my child)- that - look! &#034; everyone is different, and some people will really struggle/ned help etc&#034; If they study citizenship then why not teach them about all the different problems so many children seem to be facing, ADHD, AUTISM, downs syndrome, aspergers. 21st century mondernised britain and children still have no idea what the others might be going through.

Deleted profile,"We have recently moved to a new area and my daughter has started to attend a new school last term (She is 9). 

She has had a good first term but after the summer holidays she has had problems with three girls in her class. One of the girls has been spoken to and has apologised and we have had no further problems from her, however, the other two girls have carried on being unkind to my daughter. One of these girls was a good friend of my daughter initially and they were getting on well - and for some reason another girl has joined the twosome and started deliberately excluding my daughter, by not letting her work with them at group time and not letting her join in their team in P.E and also telling her to go away at playtime etc. the original good friend of my daughter is letting this happen and going along with it.

I have spoken to the school to let them know that the initial problem has been sorted with one girl but I think that the ring leader has got away with it. School have admitted that the behaviour is not acceptable and unfriendly, and said that the girls would be spoken to - however only one girl was spoken to, talked her way out of it, and then my daughter was told not to be so sensitive by her teacher!

My daughter had made another friend and was staying away from the two other girls forging a new friendship - but now they have started trying to get my daughters new friend to play with them and to also exclude my daughter from the group.

They clearly realise that they have been found out and are using more underhand tactics - which I am afraid if I go into school and say something again they will think that I am being petty - but I know it is happening whether they are being obvious about it or not!

She now does not want to go into school any more and is constantly worried that any girls that she plays with will eventually exclude her and not let her join in. I feel sick and don't want to send her in - but at the moment I am putting a brave face on it!

I am getting her involved in after school activities however it is a very small school and there are not a lot of girls her age that are not in established groups already having been at the school since Reception.

My 14 year old son started having a few verbal comments of a lad at school, it started affecting him in that he was missing school. I went to the school and they promised my son if he told them who it was who was doing the bullying they would deal with it and move him lessons away from this lad and promised it would be dealt with so that my son's name was not mentioned. Reluctantly eventually he agreed and told the name. A few days later he came out of school really upset the lad had been told off in a lesson in front of a whole class and my son's name was mentioned. Since then it has gradually got worse in that my son is now too scared to go to school. It is so difficult as this lad has only made a few threats, nothing physical and stares and looks, but it has completely changed my son his whole personality has changed. I am waiting for a counselling appointment to come through but in the meantime I am desperate for some help as to how to get him over this extreme fear of this lad. I have sat outside school with him many times trying to get him to go in which leaves us both upset and stressed. The school have now offered for him to go in half a day but even this last week he found too hard to do. He suffered panic attacks for a few weeks and I took him to the doctors but she could only really suggest he goes to counselling and there are such long waiting lists.

kir20zrc,"We've had problems with several of our neighbours for years. Long story short - dogs fouling in our garden, loud drunken parties, verbal abuse that comes under the 'hate crime' category, had to get police involved etc.

DD does not play outside as a result, I do not want her near those kids/families. On two occassions when she played outside with me watching, one set of parents approached me and accused me of threatening their DD. :shock: On two separate ocassions they accused me and both times were totally untrue. Lots of verbal and threatening talk :(

So now DD does not play outside. At first she was upset and jealous of other kids who could go out, now she's not bothered.

She has lots of friends at school, and friends at her GPs when they look after her. She does lots of after school clubs, probably more than most kids as it gives her something to do to avoid the kids in the street!

However, whenever we are outside, in our own front garden, or even driving up the street and pulling into our drive, all the kids there pull faces at both me and DD. This is often while their parents are outside too. Tonight when we got home, the kids did it again, and one boy aged about seven, grabbed his crotch and thrusted it in the direction of DD :shock:

I don't know what to do. I've had so much grief from the neighbours, it has literally made me ill and put me in hospital, their verbal and threatening behaviour is too much for me. Its been quiet the past few months because DH and I make a real effort to ignore them and pretend they don't exist, even though the loud music and yobbish behaviour continues. The police don't care much so we have no other option but to ignore it :(

But DD keeps mentioning how they are making faces at her whenever we go outside and this boy's behaviour really shocks me.

I haven't seen any of these kids at DD's after school clubs (yet) but I am worried that one day they will join and DD will have to be pulled out of these classes. I can't risk her unhappiness or even her safety.

This is more of a moan than a request for help, as I don't think there is anything more we can do :(We've had problems with several of our neighbours for years.

Lin30wsg,"Hi there

I have never posted on here before but I now dont know what to do about my little boy. I son has just gone into year 1 at school. The problems started in reception (january intake). He started off so happy to be going to school like his brother and was interested and joined in but after about 4-5 weeks he started to withdraw and have huge emotional outbursts in the class, reverted to not sharing etc. this was not like him as he has never been like that at pre school. I talked to the teacher then and to him and it seamed like there was a bit of pushing pinching etc going on. There are lots of boys in the class and all quite strong characters. Anyway he never really made friends but when I asked the teacher if things were going better they said yes a little. My older son would come home and tell me that he is playing with the older children and not with his peers. Then before summer (about 3 weeks before end of term) the teacher call me in and tells me that socially/ emotionally he is not doing very well. I was quite upset as buy then it was to late to do anything about it. She told me she just did not know what to do with him anymore she had no more ideas. He is not naughty, he is very quiet at school. Well school has started again and the first few days he bounced out the class but again the curtains are closing and he crys that he does not want to go to school. I know he was pushed around last week a bit buy the older kids but he also tells me that he does not like to go outside at play time and does not like to sit next to a few children because they call him names. I asked him if he asks to play with other children at play time and he says they tell him to go away. 

The more I think about it the more i believe that he is being bullied in some way or another. I do think it started back in reception and the emotional outbursts in the class and not sharing were caused buy the intimidation that he felt. The reception teacher did tell me that allot of the other kids stay away from him because he is so emotional and not it has probably gone on so long that he is isolated in his class. I feel so bad for him and cried my eyes out on the way home. We are also quite new to our area and I dont think that had helped because allot off the kids already had established relationships buy then. I was supposed to see the teacher yesterday but she was off sick. I dont know how to help him or what to do and I dont think the school are that interested . 

My other son is very popular so this is all so new to me.

Sorry for going on and on but its such a long saga.Hi thereI have never posted on here before but I now dont know what to do about my little boy. I son has just gone into year 1 at school. The problems started in reception (january intake). He started off so happy to be going to school like his brother and was interested and joined in but after about 4-5 weeks he started to withdraw and have huge emotional outbursts in the class, reverted to not sharing etc. this was not like him as he has never been like that at pre school. I talked to the teacher then and to him and it seamed like there was a bit of pushing pinching etc going on. There are lots of boys in the class and all quite strong characters. Anyway he never really made friends but when I asked the teacher if things were going better they said yes a little. My older son would come home and tell me that he is playing with the older children and not with his peers. Then before summer (about 3 weeks before end of term) the teacher call me in and tells me that socially/ emotionally he is not doing very well. I was quite upset as buy then it was to late to do anything about it. She told me she just did not know what to do with him anymore she had no more ideas. He is not naughty, he is very quiet at school. Well school has started again and the first few days he bounced out the class but again the curtains are closing and he crys that he does not want to go to school. I know he was pushed around last week a bit buy the older kids but he also tells me that he does not like to go outside at play time and does not like to sit next to a few children because they call him names. I asked him if he asks to play with other children at play time and he says they tell him to go away. The more I think about it the more i believe that he is being bullied in some way or another. I do think it started back in reception and the emotional outbursts in the class and not sharing were caused buy the intimidation that he felt.

Nic50ftf,"Recently, through a friend of DD1, I found out that she is being bullied over Facebook by some girls I thought were her friends. They've been posting endless comments on her 'wall', telling her how ugly and fat etc, she is. Her photos are filled with things like this in the comment section, too. 

I confronted her over it, and she told me it's going on in real life too, she's spoken to her Pupil Support teacher who phoned the girl who was doing it &#034;the most&#034;'s parents, and nothing changed. She refuses point-blank to delete her account/block the girls, because she says &#034;it will make no difference&#034;. I am honestly stuck on what to do, my DD cried for hours and begged me not to phone her teacher, but I dislike the idea of her being unhappy because of a website.

Would it be worth it to talk to the headteacher of my daughter's school, and see what action is taken, or would it be more worthwhile to report it to the police? Some of the comments are disgusting - saying things like &#034;Kill yourself&#034; and &#034;The world would be so much better without you.&#034; I've printed as much as I can off, and it's sickening.

Emm74lfl,"Hi I will try to keep it brief, on Tuesday my son and couple friends were trying to drop off their bags at their tutor group for lunch and found a group of year 11's outside the door. My son being the confident and happy boy that he is asked &#034;please can we get by to put our bags in?&#034;. The year 11 boys started to swear and make hand gestures at the year 7's.

The year 7's told their tutor and forgot all about it. Yesterday, my son was walking into school when the ringleader of the year 11's shouted and swore at him calling him a grass. He was grabbed by the collar, shook and thrown to the floor.
My son immediately walked away and the head of year was told by some year 8's that witnessed it.

The school has taken statements from the children that witnessed it and from my son. What i would like to know is what punishment should we expect for this boy? He is almost 5 years older than my son. My son has only been at this school 2 weeks and was enjoying it until now. 

I have no doubt that if this happened on the street, the police would have been called so why is it any different that it happened in the school?

Deleted profile,"Hi,

My DD came out of school today in tears. She had gone to a girl in the year above and asked her if she could play with her and the girls response was &#034;I'm not allowed to play with you because my mum said you're a tramp&#034;. Needless to say I was mortified. At her old school my dd was really popular. Since starting this school she has already been bullied once (for months) and iI know it has zapped her confidence. I'm still fuming now so had to write this down as I just wanted to cry.

I pulled the mother (nicely I might add) and just told her what had been said and that my daughter was really upset. She didn't seem too fussed and was quite defensive as her child &#034;isn't like that&#034;. Said she would have a word and see what had really happened and if it was true the girl would be in trouble. She questionned my daughter who was even more upset by this time and when her daughter came out just walked off - not a word. So I grabbed her hand and walked off.

I don't know if i did the right thing or not. My LO was so hurt and so am I. I feel terrible for moving her schools now. I think she plays with her little brother a lot at school so I get the feeling she doesn't really have many &#034;real&#034; friends. The school is quite &#034;well to do&#034; and we are not posh at all and don't live in the immediate area of poshness which I fear is making my daughter even more unpopular. I just feel like I let my drive to get her a better education ruin her happiness and feel really rotten.

Thanks for listening.

Sabrina O(5),"My son went on a playdate with a school friend over the summer holidays and when I went to pick him up the mum said she needed to talk to me.
They'd been to a local play centre and my son had been picke don by another boy at the school.

They're all 5 year olds and she said that her son had been in the same nursery as this other boy and most the parents had requested he not be in the same class as their children.

This wasn't just teasing, but physical bullying and her partner had needed to go in and pull him off my son several times.
In the end they went and spoke to the boys gran...who basically didn't care.

Its come to light that this has been going on at school too!

Well I have always taught my son NOT to fight back, but walk away, or if that doesn't work tell an adult.

I know if he does fight back he'll give a lot more than he got and will more than likely end up being the one in trouble (as they sadly often do!)

So he's been 100% doing as I told him and walking away. However this kid just doesn't let up.

I can't believe the teachers arn't aware! Or if they are they havn't bothered tell me.

Then again I have picked him up a few times last year and they've pointed out a nasty cut or bruise and said they didn't know how it happened. I assumed he was just being a boy.....but now I wonder.

There was an incident when I was called in where there had been some goings on in the toilets and my son had been &#034;the culprit&#034; yet I as also told boys from other classes had bee there............makes me wonder if maybe he DID fight back on one occation. However as no adult was there it was taken on kids words. My son isn't one to stick up for himself if he knows he's done something wrong.

I don't really want to start the new year and a new teacher with &#034;by the way I found out over the summer he's been bullied at school and you've not done anything about it&#034;. 

I'm also just so shocked that this would happen at 5!!!!!

I was kicked/punched at school for basically being a goody two shoes and also not having the &#034;latest fashion&#034; brands. However I was 14/15 not 5! Untile then yes there has been some name calling and teasing....but none of this physically behaviour :/My son went on a playdate with a school friend over the summer holidays and when I went to pick him up the mum said she needed to talk to me.They'd been to a local play centre and my son had been picke don by another boy at the school.They're all 5 year olds and she said that her son had been in the same nursery as this other boy and most the parents had requested he not be in the same class as their children.This wasn't just teasing, but physical bullying and her partner had needed to go in and pull him off my son several times.In the end they went and spoke to the boys gran...who basically didn't care.Its come to light that this has been going on at school too!Well I have always taught my son NOT to fight back, but walk away, or if that doesn't work tell an adult.I know if he does fight back he'll give a lot more than he got and will more than likely end up being the one in trouble (as they sadly often do!)So he's been 100% doing as I told him and walking away.

sal81kts,"Hi there

i havn't much time so will cut this as short as possible

We have moved to a new estate where lots of kids play out. when we fist moved here my son (8) had loads of children swarming round him which he absolutely loved but i knew all too well it wouldnt last. The kids around here are very confident, all the boys play footie and boyish games whereas my son has no interest and is more interested in imaginative play, he cant ride a bike/scooter well and is very 'awkward' in anything he does.

he has come home on numerous occassions in tears because someone has made fun of him or because the kids had all gone in someones garden and hed not been allowed in. 

It absolutely breaks my heart it really does and i often lock myself in the bathroom and cry for him :( 

The worse incident though was when he came home in tears saying some lad had got on top of him punching and kicking him and when he was trying to get home he just got dragged back. 

My emotions were so high i marched down the road leaving my baby in bed upstairs only to see this lad running off home, i followed him and knocked on his parents door, my son by my side.

i was met by a horrible woman and her friend (felt sick like i was at school again) that basically just laughed in my face saying who am i to come knocking on her door, she got her child and said did you do this, he said no, my son was in tears saying he did do it and getting really really upset. the woman just completely blanked him. I backed down as i was so scared and just said 'ok' and she slammed the door in my face. I went home and just cried and cried, i really cant explain how hurtful it was.

my son has become very withdrawn and quiet. He has been out again since but i looked out my window only to see the children riding away from him on their bikes and he was behind looking so unhappy. He came in later saying all the children had gone in a house and left him out.

He has been away with his dad but due back tommorow. Its the school holidays and i feel sick thinking what will happen next. MY heart cant bear to see him lonely over the holidays.

i was a single mum for 3 years and i often wander if ive made him too soft..which he is, my partner is always telling me he needs to toughen up. Partner is away (army) at the mo and his dad works abroad 9 months a year.

please give me some advise.

oh and he has nobody he can call a 'best friend', he has the same problem at school which is another story.

Please give me some kind advise or share similar stories x

i was bullied at senior school and beaten up twice (by girls)since leaving school (no reason)so i know how sick inside it can make you, it has affected my whole life since and i dont want my son feeling the way i did.

i feel i have failed him

Jul21icl,"my son has been undermined verbally, and hurt physically, repeatedly by another boy in his class in year 4.
Having been to the teacher I was told it was &#034;a joke&#034;. My child was upset and put in the frame when innocent. This continued so Imade an appointment to see the teacher. The appointment was done via a phone call and it was agreed my son should tell when things happened. He did this and was kicked on one occasion and punched on another for &#034;telling&#034;. I went in again at lunch time (taking time off work myself=a supply teacher) only to be fobbed off after 5 minutes and told these were &#034;accidents&#034; and that everything was fine as the teacher didn't see anything in class!!1 These were incidents going on at break/lunch times, and the bully was getting my son alone during games and making threats. The boy is much bigger and more boisterous than my son. This has gone on ALL YEAR and I am so angry. When on crutches for a severely sore hip he was called a &#034;wimp/fake/lazy&#034;. Well he went onto school despite severe pain, nothing wimpy about that at all actually my son is very corageous more than the bully will ever be.
I messaged the bully's mother on fb to attemp to build some bridges by taking the boys to the park- she deleted me and then gave me a mouthful of abuse one day which was itmidating... no surpirise there. I walked away but stewed over ot for a while. I am scared of her, and can feel hopow my son may feel when this boy puts himself into my son's group of friends. The teacher has also undrmined my son with her negative comments, and we now see a psychologist to get help for my son. We also see a physiotherapist, school nurse, and had a care oplan meeting recently for a condition that can flare. I am awaiting the outcome from the psychologist, who has already said she will speak wit the wshcool, but I am worried that the HT hasn't seen anything either, as despite monitoring play for a while the bully behaved himself because he knew he was being watched. I even found out my son's friend had been excluded too and she tried to tell the teacher what she had witnessed happening to my son, but the teacher told he to be quiet and then the one person who could back up my son was kept quiet. Now my son won't tell anyone but me, and I relay to the head, who then doen't apear to act on anything. Whilst some of it is kidstuff, there are two children hree who are at risk, and the culprit needs boundaries and sanctions, but is getting away with awful behaviour because his mum volunteers in school and th eteacher failed to remain impartial. My son's confidence has fallen and he has become with drwan, favouring staying in with the tv and lego, and not wanting to go out to do much at all. He is a shadow of his former self and I am sooooooo angry with the adults aroung him who are unwittingly helping and protecting the bully, who is lying his way out of everything. I just want justice and truth. Where do I go next without worrying that my son will be penalised for exposing incompetency? Help!my son has been undermined verbally, and hurt physically, repeatedly by another boy in his class in year 4.Having been to the teacher I was told it was ""a joke"". My child was upset and put in the frame when innocent. This continued so Imade an appointment to see the teacher. The appointment was done via a phone call and it was agreed my son should tell when things happened. He did this and was kicked on one occasion and punched on another for ""telling"". I went in again at lunch time (taking time off work myself=a supply teacher) only to be fobbed off after 5 minutes and told these were ""accidents"" and that everything was fine as the teacher didn't see anything in class!!1 These were incidents going on at break/lunch times, and the bully was getting my son alone during games and making threats. The boy is much bigger and more boisterous than my son. This has gone on ALL YEAR and I am so angry. When on crutches for a severely sore hip he was called a ""wimp/fake/lazy"". Well he went onto school despite severe pain, nothing wimpy about that at all actually my son is very corageous more than the bully will ever be.I messaged the bully's mother on fb to attemp to build some bridges by taking the boys to the park- she deleted me and then gave me a mouthful of abuse one day which was itmidating... no surpirise there. I walked away but stewed over ot for a while. I am scared of her, and can feel hopow my son may feel when this boy puts himself into my son's group of friends. The teacher has also undrmined my son with her negative comments, and we now see a psychologist to get help for my son. We also see a physiotherapist, school nurse, and had a care oplan meeting recently for a condition that can flare. I am awaiting the outcome from the psychologist, who has already said she will speak wit the wshcool, but I am worried that the HT  hasn't seen anything either, as despite monitoring play for a while the bully behaved himself because he knew he was being watched. I even found out my son's friend had been excluded too and she tried to tell the teacher what she had witnessed happening to my son, but the teacher told he to be quiet and then the one person who could back up my son was kept quiet.  Now my son won't tell anyone but me, and I relay to the head, who then doen't apear to act on anything.

Ann40gjg,"After I sent my child who was five years old to school in the morning, later the staff called me told me my child's lip got cut and let me to collect her.
After I arrived to school, I found the big cut on my child's lip from outside to inside, a piece of lip was hung up there, whole lips were swollen with blood, and the dress was covered with blood. the teacher did not tell me anything what happened, my child cried told me another child pushed her and told me the name, but the teacher still did not tell me what really happened, the teacher's mother was deputy head teacher, she told me nothing, the school did not give any treatment, did not call the ambulance, they said they called the taxi, but no any taxi showed up for near 30 minutes. i had to call taxi by myself, and one mother followed us out of school, she offered used her car to send us to hospital A&amp;E. 

that deputy head told others behind me said my child ran and fell, the school always gave me accident form if my child fell or bump with other child, they never gave me anything in writing if she was pushed and injured. 

On that day, after I arrived school, only the tutor was there in silence later the tutor's mother-deputy head teacher came out, both them did not tell me what happened. They gave me nothing, told me nothing. but behind me, that deputy head used lots of abusive wrong and fake information damned my child, I agreed to let assessments talk, proved that deputy head said was wrong. 

The assessments proved that there was nothing wrong with my child and me, but the school only changed management team, never apologized for those wrong information individuals used to damn my child. Till today, the school has not told me the truth what really happened on that day, how and why my child was injured badly inside school, I required the information; they only gave me several documents with wrong information about my child's attendance and insufficient information about her education. They did not give me the information about my child's injury. 

If things happened in the past were not clear, how my child can be treated fairly in another school as I was told only those several documents would be transferred to another school, What can I do to get the truth?

Melissa M(233),"I'm friendly with a mum down the school, her son and my son are both 6 years old and in the same class. They used to get along great but lately they have been fighting, but her son is very aggresive. The first time was at a birthday party, they were both wrestling and my son was winning, my friends son couldn't handle this my friends son pinched him very hard in the tummy making him cry, I told my son off for wrestling but nothing was said to my friends son, then I told them both not to wrestle because it will end in tears. A few weeks later friend and her son are at my house, again they are wrestling, my son did start winding him up saying he had a girlfriend again I told my son off, but his friend started pulling his hair and wouldn't let go so my son pulled his hair back then his friend kicked him straight in the eye and gave him a black eye.
then the friend came and got my sons toy gun and told him he was going to put it in my sons mouth and shoot him and kill him, but his mum didn't say anything. The final straw was today on the way home from school they were bickering and his friend kept saying to me my son didn't know anything he is always wrong, I simply said you both know things and none of you are wrong, then he pushed my son, my son then went to push him back, i told them both off, his friend then said he was going to kick my son in the other eye and kill him this time. I have to admit I lost it I shouted at him you will not kick my son in the eye, and I don't want you threatening to kill him again, he screamed back at me that he will kill him when he is round my house so I again shouted that he will no longer be coming to our house, well he went mad started spitting at me and his mum, biting his mum and hitting her. I managed to get home my door was open and my son went on in, i was still outside sorting my daughters pram, his friend comes running past me straight into the house and when i get in their he is on top of my son and had him in some sort of headlock, his mum got him off. I'm now worried to send my son to school, surely this isn't normal behaviour. I will be going into school to tell them what happened and keep an eye on them. I'm also thinking of changing schools.

Sus70bwr,"I've put another post on here regarding my 7 year old son being bullied. I really felt I had no choice but to withdraw him from the school. Even though they would not take my concerns seriously they still signed the form for me to change schools and in doing so have agreed to the reasons I have put on the forms.

There are 2 weeks until the summer holidays start and there is no way I am going to subject my child to returning to the school so I filled out a holiday form and they refused to authorise it. Honestly, are these people so sick and twisted that they would see my son back at the school and therefore let the bullies continue to make his life a misery?

So now I'm worrying that the education authority may contact me regarding my sons 'unauthorised absence' and that I might be fined.

Louise W(544),"Hi, I have posted on here about this before, involving the same girl and my daughter. It has been going on for three years now and the school head insists that it is just normal girls stuff. My daughter has been in the head's office twice in one week now for standing up for herself against this girl.They are Y5, and the head told me yesterday when I rang him about the lastest incident that all the staff are aware there is a problem between my daughter and this other girl (they are 9 for goodness sake!). Basically this other girl hasn't many friends and although was friendly with my daughter for a while this all went sour a couple of years back due to her meanness (not my daughter the other one). The other one whacked my daughter with her packed lunch bag last week in the dinner queue and my daughter hit her back. I have told her to stand up for herself, especially where this girl is concerened and the school knows this too, although I don't condone or promote violence the school refuses to acknowledge there is a problem. This resulted in them both being called in to the head's office, they were told it has to stop and my daughter told me this when she got home. Yesterday this other girl pushed my daughter - for no reason - so she pushed her back and the bully told the teacher. My daughter was forced to apologise and when I spoke to the head last night he said again that it is just girl stuff. How can I get him to take it seriously? He said he would have them both in the office this morning, but I don't want my daughter labelled as a trouble causer. We have now instructed our daughter to try and stay away from this girl as much as possible, and that she has not to retaliate but tell the teacher straight away if this girl bothers her anymore.I have sent a letter in to the head advising him of this, and am looking forward to his reply. He said yesterday he will ring me tomorrow, what do I say to make him see it isn't stopping?Hi, I have posted on here about this before, involving the same girl and my daughter.  It has been going on for three years now and the school head insists that it is just normal girls stuff.  My daughter has been in the head's office twice in one week now for standing up for herself against this girl.They are Y5, and the head told me yesterday when I rang him about the lastest incident that all the staff are aware there is a problem between my daughter and this other girl (they are 9 for goodness sake!).  Basically this other girl hasn't many friends and although was friendly with my daughter for a while this all went sour a couple of years back due to her meanness (not my daughter the other one).

Faye M(3),"This is going to sound really bad on my dd2's part to start with but please bear with me.

I got a phone call from my daughters headmistress on friday to say that my dd2 5 was in her office as she had grabbed another little girl by the neck. At which point the head tried to blame it on me for letting her watch things she shouldn't (unless Dora is trying to kill Boots then no). Then got to school to pick her up and told she had hit another child so they kept her in the office all afternoon. I was completely shocked as it was totally out of caracter for my dd2.

I then spoke to dd2 about it when we got home. Turns out she had been trying to get into the home corner and the another child (this little girl has been picking on her all year) had grabbed her by the the neck first. Dd2 made a bad call and retailiated. The child in the afternoon was a accident and was blown out of proportion due to what happened in the morning. Which i completely understand.
I spoke to dd2 about the dangers of what she had done and i punished her for it. Went in and spoke to the headteacher on monday and asked for the girls to be seperated. 

Fast forward to today. My dd1 told me dd2 was sat on the naughty chair outside the headmistresses office. Turns out said little girl was hurting my dd2 again. Dd2 was shouting at her that it was naughty and she shouldn't hurt her. She was the one that got punished for distrubing the class wtf the other little girl got to stay and watch the treat dvd.

I saw the little girl in action this afternoon. We had the leavers service and she was sat next to dd2. She spent the hole time podding and poking my dd2. Dd2 had tears in her eyes. She looked at her teacher and asked to go toilet to get away. Then the little girl started on the child sat the other side of her. The thing thats really got me is the headteacher was sat right in front of them and did nothing to stop her. Is she blinkered or something? Loads of the other parents came up after and asked me if dd2 was ok. 
Now i have been on facebook and i know should not have been noisey but her two teachers are disscussing dd2 on there. I am so mad right now. 

Hoping someone can advise on what to do. I have been in to school so many times about this little girl hurting dd2 and they are taking no notice of me. She seems to be able to get away with anything without any punishment. She is in the same class as dd2 next year so no escape from her as its a very small school. Any advise would be very welcome as i am at my wits end and thinking of moving dd2 to get her away but i don't really want to move my other two as ds has special needs and is very settled at the school.This is going to sound really bad on my dd2's part to start with but please bear with me.I got a phone call from my daughters headmistress on friday to say that my dd2 5 was in her office as she had grabbed another little girl by the neck.

Deleted profile,"When dropping my daughter (aged 7) to school this morning (after a huge debate that she did not want to go) she got quite upset as her so called best friend told her to go away. So my daughter is crying, I am trying to settle her so I go to her teacher for a bit of help so I can get off to work. Her teacher says 'Come and sit down and stop being so silly'! I was shocked and said 'theres no need for that, she is upset' and I continued cuddeling her.

I am so p***ed off with the teacher and I can see now why she hates her teacher. Anyway I managed to leave with a sobbing daughter and a teacher who didn't give a s**t. I got out the door and burst into tears debating whether I should go back and collect my child. I didn't go back but got to work and phoned the headmaster to voice my concerns. He did say the teacher is quite a harsh teacher and has no time for nonsense to which I asked him to sort it.

I don't think I am over-reacting but would like the view of others as to whether this is acceptable. I am not an over protective parent by no means but a simple cuddle and a bit of reassurance that she will be fine was all I expected.

Anyway with regards to the 'best friend'. She can be a lovely girl but at the same time she calls all the shots. If she wants to be 'best friends' they can be but if she decides she does not like my daughter any more she will pinch, hit or kick my daughter. I have voiced my concerns with her teachers many many times only to be told they are as bad as each other. I must state my daughter has only once done anything back, when she got kicked by 'best friend' my daughter stamped on her toe. With this incident I was called in to be notified to which her teacher said 'this was well deserved'.

I am at my wits end and putting everything together I think my daughter is being bullied by this girl. My daughter is saying EVERY morning she doesn't want to go to school, she is very angry at home and becoming quite challenging towards us and physical towards her brother. She does tell me she has nobody else to play with as nobody wants to play with her. She is a lovely girl but quite shy and I just feel she is suffering in silence on the hope that she will be accepted by her friends.

Please help with any advice, I am even considering taking her out of school at lunchtimes for a while to see if this makes a difference.When dropping my daughter (aged 7) to school this morning (after a huge debate that she did not want to go) she got quite upset as her so called best friend told her to go away.  So my daughter is crying, I am trying to settle her so I go to her teacher for a bit of help so I can get off to work.  Her teacher says 'Come and sit down and stop being so silly'!  I was shocked and said 'theres no need for that, she is upset' and I continued cuddeling her.I am so p***ed off with the teacher and I can see now why she hates her teacher.  Anyway I managed to leave with a sobbing daughter and a teacher who didn't give a s**t.  I got out the door and burst into tears debating whether I should go back and collect my child.  I didn't go back but got to work and phoned the headmaster to voice my concerns.  He did say the teacher is quite a harsh teacher and has no time for nonsense to which I asked him to sort it.I don't think I am over-reacting but would like the view of others as to whether this is acceptable.  I am not an over protective parent by no means but a simple cuddle and a bit of reassurance that she will be fine was all I expected.Anyway with regards to the 'best friend'.  She can be a lovely girl but at the same time she calls all the shots.  If she wants to be 'best friends' they can be but if she decides she does not like my daughter any more she will pinch, hit or kick my daughter.  I have voiced my concerns with her teachers many many times only to be told they are as bad as each other.  I must state my daughter has only once done anything back, when she got kicked by 'best friend' my daughter stamped on her toe.  With this incident I was called in to be notified to which her teacher said 'this was well deserved'.I am at my wits end and putting everything together I think my daughter is being bullied by this girl.  My daughter is saying EVERY morning she doesn't want to go to school, she is very angry at home and becoming quite challenging towards us and physical towards her brother.  She does tell me she has nobody else to play with as nobody wants to play with her.  She is a lovely girl but quite shy and I just feel she is suffering in silence on the hope that she will be accepted by her friends.Please help with any advice, I am even considering taking her out of school at lunchtimes for a while to see if this makes a difference.",11,"2,842", 19-06-2012 at 10.26AM

The school should have an acceptable use policy for the internet and computers, and 'on to it' schools will have the statement in there along the lines of 'will not post derogatory comments about the school, staff or fellow students', that allows them to punish over out of school things. Have a look on the school website to see if they have an acceptable use policy, most schools should now, Ofsted recommend it. Also the Safer Schools Police Officer based at the school should be able to be involved particularly if any of the comments are threatening to safety. They should involve the parents of the children particularly if they are about the same age as your son. At my school we would most likely look at internal exclusion or the like for children involved or maybe even external exclusion for the ringleader.The cybermentors website is set up to help children that have been victims of online bullying, they can listen, it is also run by under 24s I think, so a good environment.I would also recommend this site Thinkuknow - home. It is run by CEOP and there is an excellent Parent section which tells parents about what things actually are. Assertiveness tipsAssertiveness/dealing with bullies - kidscape Keeping Safe and Strong - (bullying and abuse) NSPCCChildren who bully - kidscapeNetmum member, and promoter of confidence techniques janet M(134) gives the following advice on a recent thread:Quote:I can give you a few tips and techniques for your daughter to use to build her self confidence up, so she can feel more in control of her life.First to understand that bullys are not happy people themselves for whatever reason and they only target people that they get a reaction from, normally sensitive people. Here are some tips to try.1) Posture and breathing is very important to feel confident so stand up straight with your shoulders and head up, as you walk take longer steps. Breath deeply and slowly, as you breath in imagine the colour blue or gold which is for confidence.2) Think the way a confident person thinks, which is only positive thoughts all day long, if you think negative thoughts you will only feel bad, so think positive thoughts to feel good. Don't concentrate on the bully and what might happen and what they might do, just on what you want to happen.3) Visualise that you are somebody who you really respect and look up to and would like to be like and really get into the feeling etc. so you feel and are that person.Complaint LettersSample Letters to school/governors/LEA------------------------------​------------------------------​------------------------------​---------------------Recommended books and resources about bullyingGrowing up and keeping safe CD Rom: Coles McConnell DesignFeeling Happy, Feeling Safe: Free book from the Home Office phone 0207 035 4848 and quote code NNB04 to get a copy.Bullies Aren't Sharp  - anti-bullying filmBooks from Amazon about bullying..............................​..............................​..............................​..............................​....BULLYING UK  and  PARENTLINE  have merged and become FAMILY LIVES.Family Lives",9,"10,535", 13-11-2006 at 6.29PM

Yesterday my son was subject to the following:-
1. The boy who hit him before put that my son stinks on the computer and shouted around the class. My son told the teacher nothing was said.

2. The same boy hit a door in my sons face again he told the teacher and nothing was done.

3. The same boy hit my son at playtime.

My son says the head only says to the boy don't do it again and he laughs and carries on.

I have phoned the school today as my son no longer feels the teachers are listening to him. 

I have a meeting with his teachers and head soon but would like some advice on how I can stop this happening.

The school has a view oh just sort it out yourself and heard from other parents that there have been fighting and the pupils have had to stop it.

My 12 year old has been very grumpy and angry these last 2 weeks, and has over the last 5 days or so been very upset. He has eventually told me that children in class are saying things about him. but he won't say what. He says that so called friends he has talked to, have gone and told the rest of the class and also made up lies about him. But he won't tell me what they are saying. 

The other day he got in the car after school and just cried and cried. He said he has no friends, just one and that the whole class are talking about him. 

I so don't know what to do, I'm so upset and angry about this. Its frustrating as he won't tell me exactly what they are saying and then he get's angry with me saying I keep asking and asking but he won't tell me. 

Again tonight, I've had about an hour of tears, after he was aggressive to me and called me an idiot so I sent him to his room. He then said he's being bullied at school and I'm being horrible at home. I don't want him to get away with being aggressive to me, but I'm obviously not helping him feel any better.

I tried contacting his teacher and she said that there was an incident with a text message that someone was saying nasty things about him, but they dealt with that. They never phoned me to tell me, is that right? Do secondary schools just deal with this stuff without telling you? 

Its so upsetting seeing him so upset, he wants to leave the school, He says its been going on for ages, but some of the boys he mentions I still see him with. I think he's trying to be friends with them so they like him?

Dont get me wrong, hes not soft or a tell tale - hes a sensitive little boy who wants to be everybodys friend and i feel like this school is zapping the self-confidence out of him.

basically - will it damage his education/learning to take him out of school now and for him to start school in september (weve got him into a wonderful school that hes so excited to go to) 
he would be going into school a month before he turns four.

Since year 1 a girl who used be ok with my daughter has managed to turn the majority of their class against my daughter. It's spread beyond the class. This girl is a popular one and very influencial. On a daily basis she is called ugly, hairy legs, beefy, idiot and stupid. I have been into school many times and despite strategies being put in place to help the situation it just seems to be getting worse. Like I said, pupils who are in different classes call her names. She's had her posessions damaged, her chair pulled out from underneath her and one lunch time a couple of girls decided to wipe their hands on her cardigan!

What can I do? There is another local school but she won't go there because 2 girls would be in her class that made her life difficult at brownies. I'm so scared that will continue into secondary school and get even worse.

She has gone from being a very bright and intelligent little girl in her reception class to being very introverted and clinging to the teachers and not completing her work since she started year 1 this September. I know the girl who is bullying her, she's a very headstrong girl who does not listen to anything her mum or teachers tell her, which is why I can't see how this problem can be resolved. My daughter asked me if she could be moved out of the girl in question's group when they do group activities, but it appears this is not an option as the children are split into groups according to their ability, and both girls are obviously at the same level. I would really appreciate some advice on where to go from here, it breaks my heart to see my daughter so upset, and can fully understand what she's going through as I was bullied myself all through senior school. Unfortunately my parents didn't address the problem so it continued from the day I started senior school till the day I left. I don't want this to happen with my daughter, it's not fair that such an intelligent girl who until recently loved school and cried when the school holidays came now does not want to go to school and is at risk of falling behind. :(

My son started reception in september in a good school in a good area with a fab ofsted. I was really happy that he got in however I am concerned about the number of incidents but wonder if I am over reacting?

He has been pushed over causing a massive egg on his head and the teacher didnt tell me.
He has been kicked in the face (the teacher said by accident my son said it was deliberate) causing a bad nose bleed
He says that a certain child keeps hitting him 

Today he has come home with bad scratches on his face, the teacher didnt send a note or make contact with me to tell me how they got there. My son said a child wanted a toy that he had so attacked him. apparently a TA saw and gave my son a tissue but didnt clean or disinfect the scratch.

I am going to speak to them tomorrow but is this sort of 'rough and tumble' expected at school, it wasnt allowed at the nursery they went too but is school different?

I understand schools have to take bullying allegations seriously but the class teacher is the person who knows this situation best, as she is there all day. Neither you nor the other mum is so both of you are hearing what's happening from your DD's. I do think a meeting under controlled circumstances would be best in this case. It might make the other parent realise how upsetting this is for your child.Would it help if you and your DD had a meeting with the other girl and her mum plus the class teacher and head teacher to get this sorted properly?  As far as I can see it's just escalating and your poor DD must be fed up with getting blamed for everything.  I understand schools have to take bullying allegations seriously but the class teacher is the person who  knows this situation best, as she is there all day.  Neither you nor the other mum is so both of you are hearing what's happening from your DD's.  I do think a meeting under controlled circumstances would be best in this case.  It might make the other parent realise how upsetting this is for your child.",9,"15,705", 04-03-2012 at 3.56PM

He's highly confident in ICT &amp; excels in maths. grammar school specialises in Maths &amp; computing. Son can build his already sound skills in ICT by taking computing.

Now thing is, neighbours child who's been bullying my son (name calling &amp; broke his scooter a while back), goes to offered comprehension school, but 2 yrs old.

I don't know how to prove the bullying in my appeal as I don't want my son mixing with this boy &amp; know it will have an adverse affect on his schooling.

mel32gnv,"this is not the first time ive posted i have 3 sons my eldest is 6 and is having problems we are frequently called over after school being told he hit or kicked someone but the boys he hit are the same group of 5 boys in his class 
we ask him what happend, as the school only know half the story and he said he never hit first. we also noticed him coming home with unexplained injuries,this has happend few times since he started school.. and has had run ins with boys since he started first week of school boy bit him... friday scratches down his face looks like finger nails teacher had a go saying she wouldnt have him in her class any more if it happens again he had kicked a boy, but she failed to tell me the boy had caused these scratches first! 

i have always said hit back but never hit first but last year changed to tell the teacher as hitting back was getting him in trouble our son said teachers ignore him.

 we have informed head and teachers of our concerns in october 2011 its still happening our son and these boys fighting!!!

 our son is now angry at home and not liking school we havent got anywhere with head teacher he said our son has behaviour problems ... but this still wouldnt make it ok for our son to be injured and us not to be told about it on a number of occassions, and to make light of our concerns over other boys bullying

 i have witnessed these boys ganging up around my son before school we have had council behaviour support team involved

 i would just move schools but other local schools were full and i would need a place for my son in yr 1 but also my middle son in reception..... i dont know if i should take further action against the school as my sons behaviour at home is now changing and we have given them chance after chance since oct and nothing has improved! my husband says take further action..... but how do i do it? do i involve governers?

tracey h(456),"my son is 4, started reception in 2011, he's a gentle, sweet natured, lovely little boy (actually the smallest boy in reception) who doesn't like rough and tumble games and would sooner play in the classroom kitchen making pretend cups of teas! he started reception in sept 11 and will play with anybody who will play &#034;nice&#034; and does have some nice friends. because he's so small he does tend to get knocked about a bit by the &#034;bigger boys&#034; in rough play, i know this is normal playing and i am OK with this, but recently there has been this same boy who keeps hurting him in a deliberate way and being mean to him. like your son, Leon says they play together and when he hurts him it &#034;doesn't matter&#034;, &#034;i'm OK&#034; , or &#034;i wanted to cry but i didn't, was that brave mummy&#034; heartbreaking isn't it, he wont hit back, (I've just brought him up to be kind and caring and taught him that hitting and hurting is wrong) knowing you cant be there to protect them. over the last week and a half there has been 3 separate incidents that this same boy has hurt and been mean to my son, as well as the other sly hits and kicks he gives him. last tues, he came out of school very quiet with tears in his eyes, and asked (in a whisper) if his chin was bleeding! i looked and told him i could only see a red mark, it was only when we got near the car he would tell me what had happened, when lining up at home time this same boy had asked leon for a book bag fight! leon said no, but this boy still swung his book bag at him, hitting him on the chin. i played it down cause i could only see a little scratch, rubbed it better, n put some magic cream on when we got home and had a little chat about the usual- telling the teacher, he promised me he would and we left it at that, 2 days later, (thurs) getting him ready for school in the morning i spotted just underneath his chin a horrible purple/ blue bruise the size of a ten pence, (yes i know, i cant believe i didnt see it before but i didnt) i was horrified! it must of hurt so much, and i felt so bad for my lovely little boy that i'd played it down, when really that boy had given him such a hard whack it caused a bruise. i went in school that same morning and explained what had happened and had they noticed the bruise, they said no, they would see into it and for me to come back at home time, when i went back, they told me they had asked the boy about it, but the boy said he couldn't remember!, all they could do was to remind ALL the children not to swing bookbags about as they can cause accidents. when i got home that same night i asked leon if any of the teachers saw the bruise, (because it then made me think about the schools policy to &#034;protect&#034; children in their care, wondering, god i hope they dont think i've done it!) he said &#034;yes n she asked me what happened and i told her alfie thornton did it with his bookbag!. so they DID know about it. 
over the weekend gave him a little extra tlc, etc. This monday, back at school, leon said everybody played nice, on Tues while having tea, i asked Leon what had he had for his lunch, he said &#034;i had chicken and rice&#034; then went very quiet, i then asked him what pudding/dessert he'd picked, after a few seconds without looking at me he said &#034;i didnt get a pudding, more silence, i eventually got the story out of him that &#034;alfie pushed me out of the line and wouldn't let me back in&#034;, Leon being Leon i just knew without him even telling me that he'd just walked away without his pudding and sat down, n that's what he'd done, i asked him why did he not get back in line, he said &#034;he couldn't, he just went and sat down without his dessert, when all the others had theirs&#034; (how sad is this) and also where was the dinner ladies/teachers. Leon had said he couldn't see any when i asked him
So yesterday morning i was back in school! had a quick word with one of the teachers, said she would look into it and to come back at home time, went back, teacher had asked alfie about it,she said he admitted to pushing leon out of the line, but that didnt stop leon from getting his pudding!, she then bent down to leon and said to him, &#034;leon, you need to speak up and tell the the dinner ladies or teachers, your mummy is upset, thinking you missed out on your pudding&#034; i then interupted her to say leon DIDNT get it, he just walked away and sat down because thats the way he is, its just not in his nature to push back in line. &#034;well we dont really know that for sure do we&#034; was her reply. at that, i picked leon up because i could see he wanted to cry (being told off for not speaking up and not believing him!!!) and just asked for them to keep a look out, was told they would have a word with the dinner ladies and they would keep my son and the other boy seperated at dinner time. so i thanked them, and went home. spent another night with leon cuddled up on my knee and me trying to explain gently about it being imported that he needs to let a teacher know straight away, what has happened.
This boy has frightened my son, leon is a very caring, sweet little boy, quite small for his age, and i'll just say this other boy is taller and is quite 'chunky', a good head and shoulders bigger than leon.
well, today (thurs)....... did remind my son this morning to be brave and tell the teachers if anything happens and to just play with nice boys and girls today, gave him a big kiss and a squeeze n off he went. Home time came, made a comment with my friend n said lets see if he's been bashed up today, he's probably been hiding in a cupboard!!!!!! out he came, all smiles...... with a deep double scratch up his cheek, missing his eye, then carrying up onto his eye lid!! i felt sick, mad and so upset for him, i held on to his hands, knelt down and just said how had he done that to his face, he tried to bury his head in me but i lifted his head up and repeated myself, leon then said &#034;i dont know&#034;. i took him straight back into the classroom and waited for all the other kids to leave and to wait for a teacher. then one of his teachers came to me, i just lifted his head up to show her his face and didnt say anything, we both knelt down with leon and the teacher started asking leon how it had happened, he said he didnt know, she asked him if a boy or girl did it, he shook his head, she asked him had he caught his face on anything, he just shook his head, by this time another teacher came along and looked surprised at the scratch and then she tried to question him. His eyes welled up and i could see he was trying really hard not to cry, at this point i told the teachers i would talk to him at home and went away. how on earth did the teachers miss this one? this incident must of lasted ten minutes and not one teacher saw anything, OR noticed the deep red scratch he went back in class with. This is what leon eventually told me what had happened
leon, alfie t******, and tommy h**** where playing outside on the climbing frame/slide, alfie put his arm accross the slide and said &#034;leon wasnt allowed to come down&#034;. when leon slid down, alfie grabbed leons face, scratching his cheek and eye lid with his nails (i'm thankful at least leon shut his eyes) leon said &#034;he was going to tell the teacher!&#034;, alfie said &#034; no dont&#034;, then got a bike and started to &#034;ride round and round me, fast, so i couldnt get past&#034; leon asked him to &#034;stop&#034;, he said even tommy asked him to stop but alfie shouted &#034;no&#034; ....
couldnt get anymore out of leon, he'd had enough, and so had i. another pitiful night where we just played and played, with me looking at him and wondering what must this lovely little boy be going through, whats he thinking, how he's feeling, i'm so so upset, who is responsible for this,? Leon because he's frightened of telling? me because i cant be there? 
After leon had gone to bed my friend ( a parent from school) rang me to see if i was ok (she'd seen me go back in class)and had something happened to leon again, because she'd spoken to another parent in the carpark who told her that her son Thomas had said &#034;alfie hurt leon today on the geen slide, he hurt leons cheek! now i had not told either parent anything what Leon had told me, Thomas had seen what had happened. back in school again tomorrow!

i dont want my son becoming withdrawn, and sad becuase of how certain children at this school are treating him. how sad and confused must he be feeling, and how does a 4 yr old put these feelings into words, the answer is he cant, doesnt know how, is my son so frightened he's bottling it all up and probably just hopes the next day is going to be better. i want this sorting out PROPERLY. in my opinion alfie th****** needs to be supervised/monitered/shadowed (or whatever you want to call it) more closely, or if it's more appropriate, supervise/monitor/shadow MY son to prevent him from carrying on with his aggressive and dangerous behavior, and also to protect Leon and maybe other children, are we waiting for a serious injury? if this matter isnt sorted out, i feel i will have no other alternative but to take leon out of school and write a formal letter to OFSTED, as i will not tolerate the slackness in problem solving by the staff at this school when the matter is getting as serious as this one and so little has been done about it!
if you have any advise on what i should do, sorry its a very very long message, i just wanted to give you the whole picture
yours sincerely

Mar15zzw,"Hi, I'm hoping to get some much needed advice. I got home from work today to the news that another child in my son's class (5 years old) had deliberately urinated in his face today when they were both in the toilets. This isn't an isolated incident - the same child has been in trouble in the past few weeks for harassing my son in the playground and also shoving and pushing him, and a few other kids have also had a pop at my son - he is quite gentle and shy and seems to be fair game at the moment for anyone in the class who fancies picking on someone, but this latest incident is the most disturbing so far.

My question is - what should I expect the school to do about the urinating in particular? I'm going into the school to ask to speak to someone tomorrow, and it will help me if I've got an idea of what they ought to be doing in the circumstances. Peeing in someone's face seems like a pretty serious thing to do, and the more seriously they take it the better, but I don't want to damage my relationship with the school by seeming to overreact. Am I going to look dumb if I demand that they call the other child's parents in to see the head, for instance?

Hope you can help and with kind wishes to anyone else having a rubbish night,

Haylie Y,"My son has just started year 7 at secondary school. We have already had two incidents of racist remarks made towards him. The first time my son phoned me from the toilets stating someone had called him a racist name, the buy in question has been in quite a bit of trouble already although not racism. My son was crying so I told him to walk out of school and meet me as I was nearby. Anyway to cut a long story short the school said it was his word against the others boys and there was no proof! Even though I gave two names of boys who heard it.

Now a different boy has been going round showing pictures of my son saying look at that (racist name). He said to my sons girlfriend why are you going out with that *****. The girls told my son and they both went to tell the teachers. Anyway I phoned the school last night and was told the boy was going to get a detention and his parents would be called in to discuss the situation as there was a witness this time.

The school have just phoned me back and told me the boy got a good telling off, no detention - but he will get one if it happens again and they phoned his mum who was very cross. They told the boy if this happens again he would be in serious trouble.

I asked the teacher to send me out the schools anti-bullying policy along with the schools behaviour policy to which she said we don't have any!! They are in the process of writing one!

don14pbn,"hello i am righting this on behave of a friend. Her daughter is in year 7 and is getting bullied by a group from year 9/10. this includes physical bullying- hitting, kicking, throwing food. and verbal- calling names, swearing. and emotional bullying ( i believe all bullying effects someone emotionally)

anyway coincidentally this is the same school that i went to when i was younger and also got bullied badly. The school doesn't believe it is happening, even after being shown a video. From my experience the school doesn't do much and the child is left to deal with it. I ended up not going to school as i hated it so much. has anyone got any advice as the mother has spoke to the head and they are still not doing anything.

on a similar but unrelated matter i also feel that teachers also (sometimes unintentionally) bully or/and make things worse. I feel sometimes it would be better for the school to support those being bullied while finding the route course of the bullying, showing them why it is wrong and trying to get it in their head, and finding out why the bully does it, i don't just mean why they pick on the victim but if there is anything going on in the bully's life which is causing them to act this way, but this is obviously not always possible.hello i am righting this on behave of a friend.

Suz61nkb,"Hi there, 

I'm in a tricky situation where I have tried to have two conversations with a friend who's child hurts mine ( biting, hitting etc) along with other children in the group of friends. It has been going on for some time which I am ashamed that I haven't done anything sooner but after last week I decided it had to stop. I have spoken to nursery and asked them to ensure it doesn't happen there (which it doesn't as there are good boundaries in place ) and have decided all I can do is be with them to intervene before things get heated. Does anyone have any suggestions?

Deleted profile,"Hi there,

My son who is 5 is a loving gentle boy, he loves usual boys stuff and is popular among his friends, the only thing is he is such a target for bullies:( 

If he is hit/punched he wont say a thing, he doesn't cry or get angry, just sort of dusts himself off and finds someone else.

He had problems last year with a particular boy, it was always the same boy he didn't like my son playing with 'his' friends this resulted in two big serious accidents last year one of which he needed hospital treatment, after this, the school came down on the bully like a ton of bricks and everything was fine.

This same boy is up to his tricks again, since school has started he has kicked my sons legs and left cuts and bruises, pushed him on the floor and jumped on his back, I have spoke to his teacher who said it will stop, but today my son came home with a huge bump on his head, when I asked how this happened he said the boy did it by punching him and throwing him on the floor, when I asked why this boy did this my son replied because he was showing his new school shoes to his other friend.

Now I have been into the school before and they have been very sympathetic with my concerns, but do stress my son must tell a teacher, I reply to them as an EYP myself it is not up to my son to sort this out himself, if he feels threatened he will not speak, which is OK, every child has different needs and is an individual, and so should be treated as one, after all it is up to the school to sort out bullies, it should not be left to my 5 year old son.

I really do not want to be blown off by the school, this boy has had far to many opportunism to hurt my son, not just pick on him but cause injuries, I really want to know what they plan to do to help my son.

I am so stuck on what to say, I don't want excuses I don't want the boys parents called, I want something done !!

Cha86qau,"My 9 year old Daughter was picked on at school in year 3 (2 school years ago) for the majority of the year by a girl in her class. She singled her out, wouldnt let her play, stopped her best friend from playing with her at playtime &amp; would sit between them in class. She would say horrible things to her too like noone likes you etc. The childs mother works at the school as a lunchtime assistant and My DD would tell her at playtime that her daughter wasnt being nice, and the mother would say &#034;There is nothing I can do about it&#034;!!!
I approached the school on at least 3 occasions and dont really feel it was dealt with very well.

Last year in year 4 a group of boys started picking on her (4 that she has mentioned) with one main ring leader (a very mixed up child who is extremely naughty - he has thrown chairs/escaped from school/constantly swears etc). He keeps calling her fat (despite her being very skinny &amp; only 4 stone) and she came home saying she was fat at one point!!! She keeps going to the toilet half way through dinner most nights so I am worried she may be making herself sick! Although I am not certain! 
He has threatened to beat her up. He threw something in her face in the classroom and bruised her face. He says that everybody hates her and that she gets her clothes from oxfam (she doesnt)! They call her &#034;Ebay girl&#034; because she has got some Tracy Beaker (her favourite character) things from ebay (which is the only place you can get Tracy Beaker stuff from now).
His 2-3 &#034;sheep&#034; accomplices do the same to her.

She has been back at school a few weeks now and 2 of the boys are continuing to be horrible. and a girl (not the one from before)

She has started saying she hates her hair, she hates herself, she is ugly etc :(
She says no-one likes her and she only has 2 or 3 friends. 
She also mentioned running away :shock: Which she said was a joke!!!

I dont know what is making her an easy target!!! She was very quiet at school from day 1 and in reception and year one I would sometimes drive past at playtime (school is on next road) and see her alone :( She has made 5 close friendships, yet they have all moved house so left her school :(

She has now started saying there is no point in making friends as they will leave!!! And has even spoke of changing school (when in the past I mentioned moving to a bigger house &amp; new school and she was upset and adament she wanted to stay here).

Every year her school reports have said she has been above average (since reception), in almost all of her subjects. Yet this year the only subject she was above average in is English...I am worried that the way she is feeling is affecting her education now as she is very bright and able to achieve higher than average (without me pushing her at all) as has done every year. 

I feel guilty too as I have had depression since she was 2 years old. Then I recovered when she was 4-5 then fell pregnant with DD2 (now 3) and got very bad PND. I am starting to think maybe my depression has played a part in it too (how she feels). I am still not 100% better myself and have low days, I also find myself telling off the children lots because they never listen to me, and I feel like i have no authority. 

I really dont know what to do as I am worried she is getting depressed :( her mood is quite flat most of the time.

I spoke to the school this morning - yet doubt they will do anything as they havent done much the past 2 years :(

Has anyone else experienced this with their child?

Kir27hyw,"Hi all 

On Wednesday when I went to collect my little boy from his nursery they told me he had been naughty. Apparently he was hitting the other children and bundling them! They said it was so out of character for him as he is normally so good. They said they asked him to stop it and he ignored them so they sat him outside the room which he hated and screamed. Once he came back in he was sorry as he kept giving out cuddles and kisses. 

This is the second time I have been told he was naughty the first time they didn't need to do anything as he stopped when asked, (he was throwing sand at another child) 

When I dropped him off this morning he cried when I left him - he never does this, he is always so keen to go. Now I can't stop worrying about him and wondering if there is more to it? 

Also, I am not sure I like the idea of someone else punishing my son, but I would like them to do it if it was another child. Is this the norm with other nurseries? 

He is 2 in June and cannot tell me what happened which makes it even more difficult, maybe it is just the terrible two's come early?

Natalie L(195),"DD (3) has been bullied by a boy in her nursery since she started in september. I've complained 9 times to the nursery staff but all they do is watch him for a day or two then the bullying starts again. On Monday my daughter refused to go in saying she was scared. I'd had enough at that point and went in to speak to the head. He told me he'd keep a log book of any incidents, that he'd get the staff to encourage her to tell them if there had been any incidents and they'd let me know when I picked her up every day if anything had happened, though how all that is meant to stop the actual bullying I'm not sure. He also said he'd ask the staff to watch him closely everyday and if I could get her to go in the next day they'd reassure her they'd keep her safe. So I took her to school yesterday and when I picked her up no one said anything so I assumed nothing had happened. But when I took her back in this morning her teacher told me there had been an incident where the boy had grabbed her by the face and pulled her cheek. I asked dd if he had hurt her yesterday (expecting to be told of the same incident) and she said he'd grabbed her and squeezed and hurt her back. So 2 incidents the day after I spoke to the head! I'm now taking her out of the nursery but I want to put a complaint in to someone higher but I'm not sure who or how to?DD (3) has been bullied by a boy in her nursery since she started in september.

So I took her to school yesterday and when I picked her up no one said anything so I assumed nothing had happened. But when I took her back in this morning her teacher told me there had been an incident where the boy had grabbed her by the face and pulled her cheek. I asked dd if he had hurt her yesterday (expecting to be told of the same incident) and she said he'd grabbed her and squeezed and hurt her back. So 2 incidents the day after I spoke to the head! I'm now taking her out of the nursery but I want to put a complaint in to someone higher but I'm not sure who or how to?",4,"1,436", 11-01-2012 at 9.43AM

Ang81zgl,"Hi,

I have a five year old daughter who is level headed but also sensitive. She has been toilet trained since 25months and has never wet the bed until two episodes in the last week (just prior to getting up). She thoroughly enjoys school but today did not want to go in. She is never off sick from school but today I agreed to keep her at home to spend some quality time together (I work full time and my children come first) as something was definitely not right. After a fairly long conversation it transpired that the reason she did not like school is that the other children are so horrible and spiteful to each other (words including hitting, biting, scratching, cutting, kicking etc). Also there have been several incidents where my daughter has been personally involved and has told the teacher as we have advised, but the other children's poor behaviour in general is having a profound effect on my daughter. 

I was exactly the same as a child and still am now, I cannot stand hearing people arguing or being malicious towards each other. I had a fantastic childhood and my parents never once argued.

I have every expectation that this is something that she will (unfortunately) just have to get used to, but I would be very grateful if anyone can come up with any suggestions please!

I immediately collected my son from school as apparently this boy (who goes to another school having been expelled from my son's school) has said he is going to get him tonight, so I fear for his safety and have told school he is staying with me until this is resolved. I also intend to take him and collect him from now on (we are moving soon so thank god he will be away from this).

Anyway the advice I need is that I have contacted the police and they are coming this afternoon to speak to my son. I want to take this further and prosecute this boy for assault and criminal damage (and his cronies if he names them).

She is a very placid, easy-going little girl and adores her baby brother who is a year old and has Down's Syndrome. 
To my daughter he is just like any other little boy. She loves and accepts him for who he is, as do most of her friends. 

Yesterday she came home from school very upset and after a while she opened up to me (she was worried about telling me as she said she thought it would make me sad) that an older girl (in the top year) had said that my daughter's baby brother was &#034;funny looking&#034; and had been pulling her face (pulling her eyes and sticking her tongue out) to show what he looked like. 
My daughter has been so upset by this and has begged me not to tell the teacher as she is convinced this girl will get on at her for &#034;telling&#034; and make things worse. 
I have told my daughter to take no notice of the girl's comments and emphasized that we know her little brother is lovely and that is all that matters. 
Do you think I should mention it to the school even though my daughter has begged me not to? 
It's hard to know what to do really as I don't want to make things worse for her and the chances are it will blow over.

 When nothing seemed to work and the school didnt seem to be being effective with there actions i went to the headteacher several times over until i think she got fed up of the sight of me and when that didnt make any difference i wrote the head a letter,the teacher and the school governor saying that unless i see some action being taken that i would remove my son from the school and then have the story published. I think this kind of scared them but the real change came from my son who has taken note of me trying to explain to him what makes a good friend and what doesnt make a good friend, he has since made a new set of friends and doesnt feel the need to play with the so called friend that used to bully him, he seems so much more confident now and happy.:D My son was constantly being hit and left out of activities at break times by his supposed best friends, he was constantly coming home with stracthes and marks from being hit and randomly attacked by class mates at school.

Lou96neg,"Hi,

My daughter (14) has been in hospital for 4 months because of anorexia, she was bullyied heavily before and whilst she was ill, therefore making the situation worse (even perhaps being the sole cause of the mental illness). The school failed to act on the bullies AT ALL before she went to hospital. Now she is home and has tried to return to school last week only for a couple of lessons at a time, it went terribly. The bullies are still behaving the same way and the school just will not do anything, they even denied there being any problem before she went to hospital!! they clearly know there were problems before because I was never off the phone to them! What exactly can I do, I believe at this time that she doesn't in fact NEED to be at school, although she has been discharged from hospital she is still very mentally unstable, they have only discharged her because she is physically much better. we are currently under the care of the community team but it all seems a bit of a let down to be honset and I'm not sure what we can do.

Does anyone know

What action we can expect from the school

If there are specialist schools or units that will take children in these situations, there are enough schools that take children that have been excluded but I cant find any for children who cant attend mainstream school through no fault of their own.

Also if my son s playing with another group- the next door kid will play-(feeling like he cant control mine) then tell my son to leave!! 
He s only 5 and his confidence is on the floor- I know it will affect him in the future- he already says he s not good enough. Its heart breaking.

Ann31lgl,"Hi,
I'm looking for some advice really. I was very badly bullied at secondary school, to the point where I developed social anxiety disorder &amp; still struggle a lot,I blush &amp; struggle with mixing with people. I became very withdrawn &amp; did a job where I worked with animals &amp; wouldn't have to deal with people. Since having my children I've tried to overcome some of this &amp; am definately better than I was, but still much shyer than most people. I hate the school run, but have made friends with a few of the other mums.
My eldest little boy didn't mix at all at pre-school, but since he's been at school he has some friends &amp; is a lot more confident. He has hypermobility syndrome, so is very clumsy &amp; gets tired easily, he also is a bit like me &amp; is quite introverted.
At a party at the weekend I noticed a boy out of his class speak to him really nastily, but I didn't say anything. At bed time tonight he told me that this boy &amp; his friend had been taunting my other son (who's only 3) at lunch time (the pre-school's on school grounds) &amp; he'd told them to leave his brother alone. I asked if they ever said anything mean to him &amp; he said 'everyday' They say they 'don't like him &amp; to shut up &amp; go away.' I know a different boy has already told him he can't play a number of times.
He said he's told the teacher &amp; she spoke to them, but I don't know what to do or say. I feel like it's my fault for not having easy social skills &amp; confidence for my children to learn from ...like I've set them up to be bullied. 
I don't know wether to tell them to tell the teacher, for me to speak to the teacher, to speak to the mum, to tell them to ignore them, or to speak up for himself. I don't know if I'm making a mountain out of a molehill because my worse fear is my kids going through hell at school like I did.

I just feel totally s***.Hi,I'm looking for some advice really.

louise d(358),"Have been meaning to post on here for a while cept its such a long story didnt know where to start..
 My son is 8yrs old &amp; has been bullied since he was 6yrs. We moved him in year 1( we moved to next village &amp; he seemed young enough to bounce bk) At first things were ok.. he only had a few months before summer hols anyway. When he went bk in yr 2 it all started. :(
 He came home with bruises and upset to start with. Then it progressed and he started saying awful things, he didnt want to be here anymore, he wished he was dead. I were horrified. We had been reporting to the school as it happened. When he told me exactly how he was going to do it, I called the school 'nurse' and told her I was taking this very seriously of course &amp; asked her if I needed to take it a step further and lock up the knives etc:( She was useless. All she kept asking was what did I think &amp; how do I feel about it etc etc. 
 Fast forward 2 years and things havnt changed. The threats have t himself have died down, although he is extremely angry and will have these huge episodes where I cannot control him. He will just lose all control and lash out at furniture, he hits himself &amp; grabs at his face. He is usually a calm loving child, just sometimes this happens. He told the support teacher, who was fantastic about it with us, that he wanted to die, and she took it seriously, but yet again headteacher was no help.
 I managed to get him on a kidscape course at begining of this year, he was slightly younger then they normally take on, but they were fantastic and took note of the urgency of it all. 
 Nothing has changed, except at the begining of year 4 (the year he's in now) he made a friend with another boy in his class &amp; that seems to have helped alot, before he was on the 'buddy bench' all play/lunch. Over the last 6 months he will lash out at the other children if they annoy him. I can imagine he does this with some strenth as I struggle to control him when hes like that( will just say he has NEVER lashed out AT me or my other son) He tells me he cannot control it. I think the children know this and find it amusing.
 The children that dont make him miserable will just ignore him, despite his best efforts to be pals with them, I see it every time we walk to/ from school. 
 I applied for a new school ( the one he originally came from) at the begining of this year after debating for nearly a year. We looked round it (juniors is seperate to the infant - opposite sides of the village we came from) and it was fantastic, some of the kids even remembered him. 
 We had his place accepted and was told to wait for a letter of confirmation from the county council. We didnt get 1 &amp; my son got cold feet as he didnt want to go and end up with no friends as opposed to his 1 friend at this school. So we didnt push it.
 I am wondering if we made a big mistake as this school is useless and he is still sad/ angry sometimes. He tried to run away a few weeks ago and Im desperate now with not knowing what the right thing to do is.Have been meaning to post on here for a while cept its such a long story didnt know where to start.. My son is 8yrs old & has been bullied since he was 6yrs.

Cla84uhe,"My daughter is 9 years old, we have had issues with my daughter and other children in her classes well since she started school really, But this last year has been the worst by far, Yet last year we had thought we were turning a corner. She had a fantastic school report and she seemed to be making some good friends. Back in November 2009 we had moved and she changed schools, which we thought was a blessing, being away from the scabby kids at the last school, But as i was saying this last year has got worse, I dont know if its just her age, But we have had some really scary moments with emotional outbursts. I have been speaking with the school, and the school on the whole have been pretty good, They agree that a referral to CAMHS would be a good idea as The woman dealing with things and speaking to her about her emotional issues believes its deep routed to her fathers death just before her 3rd birthday.

One of my concerns is her class teacher, obviously my daughter goes through some tough times, and maybe some of it isnt always down to others, BUT I really feel its down to lack of control from the teachers point. Many things he seems to think she should just &#034;cope with&#034; and is &#034;petty&#034; but, I dont feel having paper shoved down her ear, or coming home with her tights all ripped cos of being pushed into bushes is &#034;petty&#034; I'll be meeting with the teacher again today. Nor do I fel her being told to &#034;shut her noise&#034; when she was clearly upset about something helps.

My daughter has now been granted some &#034;alone time&#034; 10-15 mins before the end of lunch to either calm herself down or just time to chill out if she has been wound up to breaking point by other children.

The woman at the School has also suggestest soem form of Art and drawing therapy that she will start in september.

Now call it co-incidence or maybe my over active mind, Back at feb half term she spent time at her nans (dads parents) we picked her up on way to visit my mum n dad, and My daughter was so with drawn for days, this is when i first started getting serious concerns about what she &#034;knew&#034; regarding her fathers death. As she had been writing stuff in school homework about wanting to end things, and too much noise annoying her. 

Well strangely enough this last emotional outburst happened the day after gettibng a phonecall from her nan. sub-conciously i really do think its something to do with them or her father.

Now question is, is it time to cut some ties with them, until we know more about whats going on with my daughter, as they live a good couple of hours drive from us, and their health is failing and them driving to come n get her is now in question, and my partner resfuses to keep being taxi down there n back, esp as tbh they just dont seem to look after her properly when she is there.

Now knowing my luck i've put this in the wrong place. but im feeling slightly as odds with things esp my daughters contact with her fathers family.

We are also looking into out of school clubs like cubs and even self defense classes.

Reb64gvp,"I have a 10 year old son who on a fairly regular basis is the one that a small group of boys picks on and calls names. For the most part, it isn't bullying. It is more the general silliness that you might expect - sometimes it's more but not often. I'm just not sure how I should deal with it with him. 

In the past I have tried suggesting he ignores it but then witnessed on a couple of occasions him standing on his own while these boys were teasing him and on one occasion throwing leaves at him and he was on the verge of tears but holding it together. So, ignoring wasn't suitable.

I do suspect that he doesn't react in a way to help himself - he lets them wind him up and that of course is probably why they do it to him. No matter how much I tell him I'm not sure he can always resist reacting!

Do I just brush it off as &#034;they're just being silly/not mature&#034;?

And should I be encouraging him to have an arsenal of &#034;comebacks&#034; like &#034;yeah, yeah, whatever&#034; / &#034; you're boring me now&#034; ??

There have been things in the past where he could be accused of being annoying but within the last year he has worked hard on this and all but stamped it out and I no longer want the focus to be on the &#034;could you have done something to cause it&#034; or &#034; how did you react&#034; - because this is only serving to undermine his own confidence and play him as the cause when in the vast majority of cases it's not.

I realise this is not a big issue against those poor children being properly bullied but next year he will be moving to big school and I would like him to move there with the confidence that he IS a good friend, he doesn't deserve to be treated badly and not thinking that a good day is based upon whether or not anyone has been mean to him, or whether &#034;the boys were nice to me today because they let me play football&#034;.

Tam47eaw,"Hi

My daughter who is 5 in two weeks is having major problems with bullying and every night she comes home saying no one will play with her. I suspect its because of her bowel condition which means she has to wear a pull up most of the school day. The other children call her names and just wont allow her to join in. Everyday getting her to school is a battle as she wants to stay with me then her behaviour is really bad. Iam feeling sad for her and helpless as there is nothing I can do. She will hopefully in the next few years be out of pull ups and be able to use the toilet as per her consultant but if this is the case I can only see this bullying to get worse as the children grow up. Can anyone offer any advice on how to deal with this? I have organised a birthday party and tried to invite most of the class in the hope that will help with the friendships but at a loss what else to try. Please get back to me with any tips.

We attended the girls birthday party yesterday and the first greeting my dd got was this girl and another girl saying 'i thought you said you werent inviting her' to which she replied' i know but i had to invite her';then they proceeded to leave her out of everything.dd had to continually ask if she could join in and when the girl announced in front of her other class mates 'who wants ***** to leave the room' and some of them put their hands up she came to me in tears and asked to go before the party was done.
Im very good friends with this girls mum and i dont know what to do as the avoiding thing has only worked for a short time.these two girls are in the same class,actually they are the only two girls in the class as it is a country school.

Jan38fie,"My DS is an extremely intelligent and sensitive 11 year old in his first year of high school. We live in Yorkshire but I am a Londoner and still have the accent. He talks more like me than his peers - and actually says he doesn't want to talk like them - plus he is missing some teeth from having 3 tumours before he was a year old in his jaw, one of which when removed took 4 adult teeth with it. Add this to the fact he doesn't like sport, has dyspraxia which means his coordination isn't good so he's dreadful at sport, would rather read an encyclopaedia or Shakespeare than a comic and listens to Classical music, not pop! His heroes are Stephen Fry and John Barrowman - two very intelligent and talented Gay men. He has no cousins, no siblings he has ever lived with (he has older twin sisters who he is in contact with), no dad, no uncles or any other male relative. 

Okay, so he has suffered bullying on and off his entire school life - much of which he has been able to handle due to his intelligence and the fact he can come back with a very smart retort, usually using words his peers do not even understand!

Since he started at high school last September, however, it has started to increase and get violent at times. so far he has:

 
 Been pulled down a hill in school twice so he got covered in mud.
 Been attacked by 3 boys hitting and kicking him (he used his backpack to shield himself from the worst of it)
 Been attacked with two others where the three attackers held them down and sort of squatted over the heads as if to put their genitals in the victims' mouth
 Been hit during art class by girls - twice!
 Been hit with a stick by another boy
 Constantly called 'Gay' or asked 'Are You Gay'
 Suffered horrendous teasing and bullying in PE classes when he can't do the things and even been told by the teacher he was lazy if he tried to give up.
 Been called 'Fat, Lazy, Greedy' by every kid in one particular class one after the other - imagine 30 kids coming up to one and saying the same thing (during another PE class)
 

A few weeks ago after a PE lesson where my son was being constantly teased for being no good at sport, the teacher was checking the gym before locking up for lunch time and found DS with his head through a loop in the rope, his face going red - basically showing the first stages of asphyxia. The teacher stopped him and took him to see the Year Head who later told me that when he pointed out to DS that they were worried he could have really hurt himself, etc. DS turned and asked why he would be worried about him when he was so useless.

Last week he had the incident of all the kids in the class coming up to him and firstly asking if he was Gay and then calling him a fat, greedy pig. This all took place on a playing field during a PE lesson whilst the teacher was at the other end of the field - the same teacher who had found him hanging.

I have obviously had loads of meetings at the school but despite their assurances it hasn't improved. I'm going to now make a formal complaint about the school's handling of this, but what else can I do? I've applied for counselling for DS but it will be up to 3 months before he gets an appointment and then he only gets 3 maximum!!

DS has said that he just wishes they would all leave him alone and that he would rather no one ever spoke to him again than go through this every day. He has reached the end of his tether and I am so scared that one day it will be too much for him. What do I do? I work full time and my mother is his only other parental figure. He has very few friends (but then I don't really have any either, so I guess he didn't have anyone to learn how to maintain a friendship from) but generally he is actually happy with his own company. He has been taught to never hit back and he never swears back at them when they swear at him, just uses long words they don't understand or tries to ignore them. 

I know the latest thing is just words - but words are hurtful and you CANNOT ignore 30+ kids having a go at you. He is very honest and when they ask if he is Gay he just says he doesn't know - he's too young to know as he's not interested in Girls or Boys. He has no homophobic tendancies as I know quite a lot of Gay men, including my boss and I have always taught DS to accept everyone for who they are. 

Anything else anyone can think of to help would be most appreciated! He is starting to withdraw into himself and that is not like him - he is a cuddly, loving outgoing child usually, but this is making him even revert to holding onto an old teddy bear as though trying to go back to a time when he felt safer. It breaks my heart. 

Thanks
 JaneMy DS is an extremely intelligent and sensitive 11 year old in his first year of high school.  We live in Yorkshire but I am a Londoner and still have the accent.  He talks more like me than his peers - and actually says he doesn't want to talk like them - plus he is missing some teeth from having 3 tumours before he was a year old in his jaw, one of which when removed took 4 adult teeth with it. Add this to the fact he doesn't like sport, has dyspraxia which means his coordination isn't good so he's dreadful at sport, would rather read an encyclopaedia or Shakespeare than a comic and listens to Classical music, not pop! His heroes are Stephen Fry and John Barrowman - two very intelligent and talented Gay men.  He has no cousins, no siblings he has ever lived with (he has older twin sisters who he is in contact with), no dad, no uncles or any other male relative.  Okay, so he has suffered bullying on and off his entire school life - much of which he has been able to handle due to his intelligence and the fact he can come back with a very smart retort, usually using words his peers do not even understand!Since he started at high school last September, however, it has started to increase and get violent at times.  so far he has:[LIST]Been pulled down a hill in school twice so he got covered in mud.Been attacked by 3 boys hitting and kicking him (he used his backpack to shield himself from the worst of it)Been attacked with two others where the three attackers held them down and sort of squatted over the heads as if to put their genitals in the victims' mouthBeen hit during art class by girls - twice!Been hit with a stick by another boyConstantly called 'Gay' or asked 'Are You Gay'Suffered horrendous teasing and bullying in PE classes when he can't do the things and even been told by the teacher he was lazy if he tried to give up.Been called 'Fat, Lazy, Greedy' by every kid in one particular class one after the other - imagine 30 kids coming up to one and saying the same thing (during another PE class)[/LIST]A few weeks ago after a PE lesson where my son was being constantly teased for being no good at sport, the teacher was checking the gym before locking up for lunch time and found DS with his head through a loop in the rope, his face going red - basically showing the first stages of asphyxia.  The teacher stopped him and took him to see the Year Head who later told me that when he pointed out to DS that they were worried he could have really hurt himself, etc. DS turned and asked why he would be worried about him when he was so useless.Last week he had the incident of all the kids in the class coming up to him and firstly asking if he was Gay and then calling him a fat, greedy pig.  This all took place on a playing field during a PE lesson whilst the teacher was at the other end of the field - the same teacher who had found him hanging.I have obviously had loads of meetings at the school but despite their assurances it hasn't improved.  I'm going to now make a formal complaint about the school's handling of this, but what else can I do? I've applied for counselling for DS but it will be up to 3 months before he gets an appointment and then he only gets 3 maximum!!DS has said that he just wishes they would all leave him alone and that he would rather no one ever spoke to him again than go through this every day.  He has reached the end of his tether and I am so scared that one day it will be too much for him.  What do I do?

emm15ykf,"Hi,

Help, my 5 year old is constantly picking on our 2 year old and we are not sure why. He gets on quite well at school and his peers like him and he's a popular member of his class.

He pushes his brother and hits him, throws things at him and gets really angry at the slightest thing. he is posessive with his toys and will not let him play with him a majority of the time. our 2 year old is always in tears and we just dont know what to do about his behaviour.

We put him in time out for 5 minutes in his room if he misbehaves but he rips his books or ruins something in his room and then says that he doesn't care! he will then be ok for a while but will be back to the same ways later on in the same day or the next day.

Any advice would be very helpful as we are all having a miserable time when we go out or just at home:(Hi,Help, my 5 year old is constantly picking on our 2 year old and we are not sure why.

Jen20mfs,"Well, don't really know where to start. DD (10) is very shy, not confident and very good in school - although quite childish. I first went into school a few months ago as I initially thought dd had just had a fall-out with her friends, since then i've been watching very closely before school and can see she is definitiley being bullied. I wanted to wait until she spoke to me about it, as I didn't want to put words in her mouth.

I just keep reassuring her that i'm here if she wants to chat, while all the time going into school when I know something has happened. A few weeks ago she finally spoke to me and told me exactly who it was and what had been happening.

I immediately went into school to make the teacher aware that she had told me directly. Nothing was being done and these girls were still walking around like they owned the school.

I finally managed to speak with the head directly and since then things have moved very quick. The girls have denied it and dd and another girl being bullied by the same 4 also got called in to see the head, seperately and then together. She has also been off school for 3 days with a so-called stomach bug, however when I took her to the doctor, she advised me there was no medical condition, but that dd was so worried about it therefore, causing these problems.

It has now come to light that they all threw a dice (not sure why), and had to say sorry, this includes the children that have been bullied!!! I've got an appointment with the head later this afternoon, but wanted to get advice first. Has anyone heard of this before as i'm fuming DD has had to apologise (after pointing out she had done nothing wrong)!!!

Lea60qfw,"Hi all
I know there are other bedwetting threads but this is a little more serious as it includes bullying and I feel like I'm at my wits end 
My son is 5 1/2 and still wearing nappies at night. He's an incredibly deep sleeper and doesn't even wake up when he wets though his nappy.
We were muddling along okay but then one of his friends found out he still wears nappies and has begun teasing him about it. Unfortunately my son is very shy, sensitive and rather needy towards this child and considers him to be his best friend.
The teasing is quite serious - friend has been seen pinning him up against the wall and jerring at him about it.
My son has been upset but not about his friend being horrible just about him being a &#034;baby&#034;.
So we have tried for two weeks to cope without nappies and even if he is taken to the toilet (always still half asleep as he sleeps so deeply) twice in the night he is always still wet come the morning.
Now we are going back to school I am worried that friend will tease him in front of the other children and it will become a big playground issue. 
I am seeing this child's mother today (unfortunately we are good friends but she seems incapable of seeing how nasty her son can be) and want to speak to her about it. I know she will take it personally and be really offended. Either that or she will trn it around and say that it's my fault he's still wetting the bed.
These kids will be in the same class and while I would dearly love to have nothing more to do with them my little man is such a little sheep and seems to need this boy.
I know there are lots of different issues but I'd dearly love advice on how to speak with his mother today.
Thank you for reading this.

emm02dyz,"My 11 year Old Son is being bullied. 
I'ts his 1st year in High School and it's not been going to well for him to say the least. He is a very shy quiet boy won't stand up to anyone. Maybe it's my fault I raised him as a single mum for 9 years on my own no male figure in his life up until now, (male figure to play rough and tumble with him, football in the park you know what fathers and son's generaly do together). And then I got into a new relationship and had another child last year. Things have been hard in my son's life he doesn't ask for anything, he doesn't speak up and tell me things but I eventually get it out of him in the end. He doesn't go out with friends after school. He comes home and thats him infront of the telly or some sort of computer game. 

I've recently found out he is being bullied both me and my partner have been upto the school to speak to the teachers about all the incidences and reassured they are being dealt with. I have told my son over and over again he needs to speak to the teachers but he won't he either texts or phones me and today he got caught in lesson using his phone because he was being called names.

Ive tried instilling it in his head that name calling does'nt hurt its just words but he gets upset and I know what kids are like they see that in him and that gives them free reign to bully him more. Worse one was he was stabbed with pen's and pushed over a table. Threatened by some kid that his head will be put through the school gates. Both occasions had a dispute with the school as they keep telling me these kids have behavioural problems. In my mind or am I being synical here thats just an exscuse these teachers have now as they have no real powers to do anything to sort these kids out.

Today school have phoned me yet again to tell me about what happened and they took his phone off him. I gave him a phone so I know that he is safe or was that the wrong thing of me to do by giving him a phone. 
My son has no confidence ive offered him karate lessons and other activities that could give him the confidence he needs but he has refused. I don't know what else to do I am at my wits end now I even told him off earlier because I can't understand why he let's name calling get to him, Ive told him to call names back. I know that makes him as worse as them but I really don't know what else to tell him now.

joanna (211),"My DD is good friends with a little girl and her older brother (age 7) was really nasty to her on sunday, he pushed her over repeatedly and she hurt her head, then he told all the other children that were around that she had wet herself (not true) This is not the first time hes been mean to her, hes not a very nice kid but we are close friends with parents and its getting really awkward. When I took him to his mum and said about hurting my DD she said he was just playing a game?! 

I was pretty mad!

I am worried this is going to make our relationship awkward. I also am concerned because she is due to start school in sep which he goes to as well. I wondered if I should mention something to the teacher at the home visit? I told my DD to stay away from him but she is really good friends with his younger sister so its hard.

sam09red,"My 7 year old son had a best friend at school who is also our next door neighbour and apart from the occasional disagreement was very happy. A few months ago a boy moved in over the road with his nan (lovely lady) and joined the same class. Knowing that this boy was new and his mother had just died I encouraged my son to be friends with him so that he would settle in quickly. 

A month ago my son kept coming home in tears as the two of them would not play with him anymore and if we saw either alone just the two everything was fine if it was the two of them they would be very unkind and make up blatant lies to try to get him in trouble. In the end I spoke to the teacher and next door and situation did resolve itself.

Today the nan spoke to me to say that her grandson is now coming home crying and Lewis won't let him play :dunno: I did explain to her what has been going on for the past month as she was completely out of the loop (she does not normally do the school run). I also advised her I had spoken to the school already about it and they have assured me they don't think there is &#034;bullying&#034; issue but that they are keeping a close eye on the situation.

Anyway, I am worried and want some advise on how to help the boys get along as it really seems three is a crowd and I don't want ANY of the boys being upset. Also another issue is that we seem to be giving different advise I am telling my son that he needs to be nice because he should remember what it felt like when he was being excluded.

bar33nzy,"I will try to keep it short and to a very shortened down version LOL

 over 2 years ago we moved and since then I have had nothing but problems with my children settling into their school. Son has been bullied quite bad it took 1 1/2 years to sort, things are alot better but things still happen, he goes to seniors sept. Daughter in year 4 has never got on there, she has been bullied, punched really hard, non of the girls like her, she is one of 7, they intend to split the girl with the other class next year but them girls in that class want to get on with her either. The school trys to deal with it and it has got better but there was another incident with my son yesterday where it could have broken his neck, he was pushed backwards over someones ducking down behind him,he was lucky to get away with marks on his back and the teacher just had a chat with the boys which we wasn't happy with and told them they should be punished they got 30mins play missed. They have failed my son also as for all this time I have asked if he needs extra support and everytime they told me no, I found out a few weeks ago he could have done with some help but too late now. 

These kids just can't take to new children, I have known another 4 new children and all of them have had issues. I can't see my daughter ever being accepted even though the school keep telling me to trust them, my daughter is always saying the girls wouldn't let me play today. Anyway I snapped yesterday and have started looking at new schools for my daughter, at first I think my daughter was a little shocked and said she will see how it goes at current school because she will miss a tree, the field, the flowers but today she has said she wants to move and hopefully get some friends and she wants to move before the 6 weeks hols. I feel so sad for her, I am not one for running away and I have tried with the school loads but I broke down in the headteachers office yesterday. I am not taking this lightly but I just hope it's the right thing to do. The school has taken over 2 years how much longer can I make my lovely daughter take of being so lonely and unwanted. It's a new head and i said they need an anti bullying campaign and she just looked at me and I said it about 3 times. 

Has anyone done the same? parenting is so hard.I will try to keep it short and to a very shortened down version LOL over 2 years ago we moved and since then I have had nothing but problems with my children settling into their school.  Son has been bullied quite bad it took 1 1/2 years to sort,  things are alot better but things still happen, he goes to seniors sept.  Daughter in year 4 has never got on there, she has been bullied, punched really hard, non of the girls like her, she is one of 7, they intend to split the girl with the other class next year but them girls in that class want to get on with her either.  The school trys to deal with it and it has got better but there was another incident with my son yesterday where it could have broken his neck, he was pushed backwards over someones ducking down behind him,he was lucky to get away with marks on his back and the teacher just had a chat with the boys which we wasn't happy with and told them they should be punished they got 30mins play missed.  They have failed my son also as for all this time I have asked if he needs extra support and everytime they told me no, I found out a few weeks ago he could have done with some help but too late now.  These kids just can't take to new children, I have known another 4 new children and all of them have had issues.  I can't see my daughter ever being accepted even though the school keep telling me to trust them, my daughter is always saying the girls wouldn't let me play today.  Anyway I snapped yesterday and have started looking at new schools for my daughter, at first I think my daughter was a little shocked and said she will see how it goes at current school because she will miss a tree, the field, the flowers but today she has said she wants to move and hopefully get some friends and she wants to move before the 6 weeks hols.  I feel so sad for her, I am not one for running away and I have tried with the school loads but I broke down in the headteachers office yesterday.  I am not taking this lightly but I just hope it's the right thing to do.  The school has taken over 2 years how much longer can I make my lovely daughter take of being so lonely and unwanted.

cha46vss,hi can anyone give me some advise. my 7 year old daughter is being bullied by the new girl at school. she has a very close friendship with one of the other girls at school and has never had any problems. for the past 4 months now this new girl has been not letting her play with her friend shouting at her and isolating her. just generally trying to make her life difficult. i have spoken to the teacher and she says that the new girl is in her words 'a force to reckon with'. i have also spoken to the parents and we have arranged a few play dates but this hasn't seemed to have helped. this is now having a negative effect on her friendship because she is now scared she is going to loose her best friend and is becoming very clingy to her. my instinct is saying pull her out of school however i know how disrupting this can be to children and i don't want to cause any unnecessary upset but my daughter is now saying she doesn't want to go into year 3 with her either after the teacher told them that they need to sort it out as they have another 5 years together with is very daunting to her. please help i'm really struggling at ways to deal with this situationhi can anyone give me some advise. my 7 year old daughter is being bullied by the new girl at school. she has a very close friendship with one of the other girls at school and has never had any problems. for the past 4 months now this new girl has been not letting her play with her friend shouting at her and isolating her. just generally trying to make her life difficult. i have spoken to the teacher and she says that the new girl is in her words 'a force to reckon with'. i have also spoken to the parents and we have arranged a few play dates but this hasn't seemed to have helped. this is now having a negative effect on her friendship because she is now scared she is going to loose her best friend and is becoming very clingy to her. my instinct is saying pull her out of school however i know how disrupting this can be to children and i don't want to cause any unnecessary upset but my daughter is now saying she doesn't want to go into year 3 with her either after the teacher told them that they need to sort it out as they have another 5 years together with is very daunting to her. please help i'm really struggling at ways to deal with this situation,3,"2,849", 12-05-2011 at 4.26PM

Kat78dqr,"Hi - I'm new to this site but need advice.

My 16yo son has been bullied a fair bit this year - 1 boy in particular and it's got to the point whereby my son is ready to punch him. He feels he's been pushed too far and doesn't want the school to intervene because he when he goes to his new 6th form this year doesn't want a reputation going with him. School want to get involved because this bully is big trouble (always excluded for being racist.) My son is a gentle giant, never been in a fight in his life and I'm stuck as to what to suggest to him. He's normally called fat (he's not but bully knows it winds him up) and of course it goes on Facebook too. Today this boy has been telephoning my son and harrassing him.

I've taken pics of things the bully has said/done on FB.

Any ideas?

Sar42ugu,"Hello

there is a child in my daughter's class who is lashing out at pupils and turning over tables. The kids are cowering in the corner and kids have ended up at the medical room - my DS included. The school have admitted he has problems and it is being 'dealt with' but the problem continues. We are just expected to let our kids be attacked. My boy who was just 5yrs old, was on the toilet when this child burst in on him and shouted something at him. 

I have spoken to council and it's just lip service. They just parrot what the school says. The Police don't want to know. I don't know what to do next. Other parents have complained too. I asked the Head how many complaints had to be made before he was removed from school. She just looked at me strangely and said it wouldn't be happening. I accept some children have special needs and I have been done that path myself but when it comes to violence, that is not acceptable. After she was punched again today by this boy, I told the school my children will not be returning next week. They couldn't care less (the school). As a parent I feel the duty to protect them from harm yet why should they have their lives and education disrupted when this boy carries on regardless and he's the one at fault. It's not fair.

It's stressing us out and my children talk about this boy a lot. We try not to talk about it in front of them but they are clearly disturbed by him. Can anyone help? I live in Scotland if that makes a difference.

Alison N(67),"OK Netmums - I need some good advice.

At my son's small rural school there are two lots of &#034;bullying&#034; going on in just one year 3 group (18 kids in yr 3 and share a class with yr 4 kids). I've put bullying in quotes as I find this is a very subjective term.

One girl joined the yr 3 group a year ago. She is a bright child, but according to her mother was singled out from day one by the other girls in her peer group for being a little different (red hair, has glasses, parents not well off). It seems that she tried to make friends with two girls who were already friends and this seems to have been the catalyst for the problems. One of these two is easily angered and readily lashes out (I have seen and dealt with this myself), the other tries to be peacemaker. The &#034;new&#034; girl can be quite manipulative (also observed by myself). The new girl's mother believes her daughter is being bullied by the other girls. The other girls mothers believe that is it their daughters being bullied. Each of the 3 parents has talked to me about it and frankly I just wish they would just sort it out sensibly. Teh school is now starting to take action accusing the two girls of bullying the new girl. For me I think it may be six of one and half a dozen of the other (after all even if your daughter is being manipulative she surely doesn't deserve a physical bashing). How can I help the parents ? The mood at the school gate is pretty rubbish at the moment...

On teh boys side of the same year group we have a young man who likes to think that he is the one in control of everyone else. He tries to control the games at lunchtime and has made one rather sensitive lad very sad as he say's he cannot join in the football. I have coached my own son (who is occasionally picked on by this child) to say that it is not up to the &#034;bully&#034; to dictate who can and who can't play and that the other children must stand up to the &#034;bully&#034;. The &#034;bully's&#034; mum does not think any of this is a problem and will not discuss or talk to her son about his behaviour.

I think part of the problems for this year group is that it is a small school and so the children can't get away from each other and play with other children. If anyone's got any comments or advice I would sure appreciate it. The atmosphere amongst the parents at the mo is pretty rubbish.

Lou19biu,"My DD is 5 years old and for the last few months has been getting picked on and not allowed to play by another girl. I've been hoping it would all blow over as the girl thats being nasty's parents were seperated and fighting over the children. I hoped this would calm down when her home life did.

Nothing has changed and if anything its getting worse. The bully has recruited her best friend to join in,n ow DD is getting picked on by 2 girls. I've been to see the teacher and told her whats going on and she said she'd keep an eye on it. Nothing has been done and I didnt think it would because they arent stupid enough to do it in front of the teacher.

Now the bully girl has got a new best friend and she's joining in too. So that makes 3 girls picking on DD. If anything this third girl is worse. Her mum is a dinner lady and yesterday DD had to sit on a table on her own to eat her dinner because 'dinner lady child' told her she wasnt allowed to sit by any one and she is boss. DD told me that when she told the girl she wanted to sit with them this girl ran up to her mum to tell on her and came back saying 'my mum hates you too'

Also DD's birthday is coming up and she wants a party, she told these girls where she is having her party and these 3 girls all told her that they wouldnt be going because they didnt like it there. DD's answer was to ask them where they wanted her party to be. This gets me so mad, she should be able to have her party where she wants it and if these girls dont want to come then good I say. DD doenst see it like that.

I've told DD today to sit where she wants at dinner time that this little girl has got no right to tell her where she can or cant sit. All I want her to do is stand up for herself but DD says no. She says the teacher has told her to ignore the bullies and if she does anything back SHE will get in trouble! So why arent these bullies getting in trouble? They are getting away with it and more or less getting the message they can do what they want.

I hate sending her to school to be miserable, she was in tears here last night. She just cant understand why they are being so mean to her. I dont know what I can do about it. I've been to the teacher and the head and nothing has happened. The next step should be the school governors but 'dinner lady childs' father is a governor!My DD is 5 years old and for the last few months has been getting picked on and not allowed to play by another girl.

Ale03hal,"Bit of a long story this, but here goes. My eldest son is 8 1/2 &amp; in year 3. There are only 16 in his class (11 boys &amp; 5 girls.) Since the start of the school year my eldest seems to have been the target for most of the other boys; we've had name calling (geek, punk, 'gay', idiot, loser 'pi**er' - because our surname is Wee don) &amp; physical bullying (kicking &amp; hitting, pinning against walls in the playground, and in the classroom.) 
I've had 4 meetings so far with the school this term (1 with the class teacher, 1 with the senior teacher &amp; 2 with the head) and nothing has been resolved. 
The name calling I can handle &amp; help teach him coping mechanisms, after all no-one can control what other people say. The physical bullying is what has got me really upset - it's started happening in the classroom now as well as in the playground, and I think that if this level of violence was happening between 2 adults the police would probably be involved. I've brought my boys up to know that you don't hit back and have been telling my eldest that he must move away from the bully and tell an adult when this happens, which he has been trying to do, but the bullies follow him &amp; they're told to 'cooperate and play/work nicely together'.
I got so angry about the latest incident that I actually phoned the school last night at 5.30 and got through to the head - I have a meeting with her tomorrow, but what should I do - each time I've brought this up with her before I feel like it's been swept under the carpet so she can maintain the image of a wonderful school.

I've brought my boys up to know that you don't hit back and have been telling my eldest that he must move away from the bully and tell an adult when this happens, which he has been trying to do, but the bullies follow him & they're told to 'cooperate and play/work nicely together'.I got so angry about the latest incident that I actually phoned the school last night at 5.30 and got through to the head - I have a meeting with her tomorrow, but what should I do - each time I've brought this up with her before I feel like it's been swept under the carpet so she can maintain the image of a wonderful school. I could really do with some advice on how I get the school to take this seriously. ",8,"2,381", 23-03-2011 at 10.48AM  
Ash13kxx,"hi everyone. 
I thought I'd write a post on here as I have recently been creating a bullying support group so thought that my story may in someway help someone. :) 

I am 18 now, I have had over 10years of bullying. It first started for me in the middle of primary school. I am overweight - i know i am but i am doing something about it :lol:

It first started with just name calling (like fatty, chicken chin, etc...) but soon evolved into being pushed &amp; spat on. At the time the school I was at never took any notice even when my mum complained several times. After 2 years of what was torture to a kid i moved up to the secondry school. 

When I first started at the secondry school I tried to keep myself to my self, I made a few friends which built my confidence... to cut a very long story short they turned and started to bully me, name calling, being left out, spreading rumours - the lot. after years of battling with the school nothing was ever done. in my final year there i just put my foot down - i refused to go to school which got my mum in alot of trouble (i now hugely regret this) I only attended the last few months of school for my exams but i was revising at home using the school site. I passed my GCSE's and even got 1 A* which was a miricle. 

I had decided not to go to college but then had to as i wanted to work in travel and i needed a qualification higher than a GCSE. I went to a college 2 trains away thinking it would be a fresh start as no one knew me there. I managed to make 2 good friends in the end but had to take another handful of s**t first. 

I met a boy there, we soon got into a relationship - i had a massive group of so-called friends because i was with him. i soon learnt of all the backstabbing going on, i broke up with him and all my &#034;friends&#034; deserted me. Everytime i went to college i got spat on by them, several times i got completly beat up, 1 of these i ended up in hospital with a cut on my head where i had been pushed against a wall - I tried to just hide after this. I dropped off the course i was needing and only went in to get my english GCSE i needed. Every day became a nightmare - I'd cry every night and several times I tried to end it all. I told the college but because several of them involved had special needs they let them off (absolute disgrace in my opinion but thats another story) 

Anyway I then kept in contact with 1 of the guys on my travel and tourism course, we meet up for coffee reguarly and got really close :hug: We were soon an item and i then continued on a different course at college. I found a true group of friends that i didnt get ******* off in. 

But this is the main part of how i finally dealt with the bullys: 
- I told them i was just as good as them, infact i was better because i had never hurt ANYONE of them. 
- I told them that they could say what they like to me, I have a personality &amp; I now have the confidence to stand up to anybody. 
- Then to all the others just standing there - i said, if you watch a bully then your a bully! 

Needless to say after this they never said a word to me again. I am still pursuing the attacks as well. 


My advice if you think your child is being bullied: Talk to someone, Talk to them. They may not admit it first time but just by asking them will make them think that it isnt right and they may start to open up. 

I am in the process of setting up an advice line &amp; website giving different advice and places of which could be a help, i know there are loads of these but i just thought another view may help :) if anyone wants to chat personally to me because there child is having the same then comment and we can arrange it. 

If we dont all make a stand and say bullying is wrong, in schools, the work place, socitiy etc it will never change. 

Hope this waffle will help someone - there is hope out there. x :hug:hi everyone.

jay42hva,"Hi, this my be a long post but I have to get it off my chest as I dont know what to do :( My eldest daughter started High School last sept, since then we have had several bullying issues, I spoke to her head of year just after xmas and to be fair it all seemed to calm down. This week it has reared its ugly head again, this time with her friends turning on her. She has rung me from school (on her mobile) every day this week begging me to go and pick her up (which the school say they wont allow :/) because she is being constantly taunted, both in and out of class. Advised her yesterday to tell someone and as far as i know she has spoken to 3 different teachers, yet this is still continuing. She is being called a **** (excuse my french - not a word i like using!) and is being physically threatened by one of the girls. Now this girl who has threatened her yesterday only got her mother to ring me last nyt having a right go at me down the phone, I hate confrontation but calmly told her what her daughter had been doing (which she denied) but a lot of this I have heard on the phone as my daughter has left her phone on in her pocket so I could hear. I told my daughter I would ring the head of year myself today, and she begged me not to saying it would make matters worse, but she rang me at break time saying she cannot cope any more and she wants to move school. I am waiting for the head of year to ring me back now. problem i have if i move her is that my youngest is due to start same school in sept, and really wants to go there but I really wanted my children to be educated in the same school as they are very close. Also its a catholic scl and if i pull her out, it will be a non catholic school she attends! I really am at my wits end now with it all, just sat there and cried last night cos i dont know how to help her, and I start a new job tomorrow so this couldnt have happened at a worse time! any words of wisdom would be great from anyone.

my daughter started the school shes at now a year ago in primary 3, at first she was unsettled as expected, then after she started to relax a bit a girl started to be nasty to her, calling her names, sometimes even violent.

Things seemed to settle a bit but again my daughter was getting bullied not just from the same girl but a whole range of other children, calling my daughter fat, swearing at her etc. I went in to see the head teacher who had decided that my daughter had social problems and did not know the correct way to interact with others and that maybe a support teacher could help with this. I did not want to think that my daughter was getting bullied because she did not know the correct way to make friends and play with others but the head teacher had me thinking that this was the case, we aggreed to keep in touch and she would inform me if she thought the situation was not improving, the last time (until today) that i spoke to her was before xmas time and she said that my daughter was doing really well at school and theres no problems, but for the past week now my daughter has been crying herself to sleep, not wanting to go to school, boys and girls in her class being really nasty to her, a boy has been threating her with violence, they all call her fat (fat rolling meatball is the nickname for her) i have foned the head teacher today who has informed me that she is dealing with, but how do i know this? its almost a year of constant bullying, and i dont feel like my daughter is getting the support that she needs.

sarah f(567),"My son is 5 and only been at school since Jan'10. There is a boy in his year whom we have known since they were both small, but the other boy has always been very rough - pushing, thumping, throwing toys and horrible generally. My son is quite placid. 

Obviously the other children know what J is like and steer clear of him, but he follows my son round in the playground and won't leave him alone. If J is horrible to him he has been telling the teacher but know J said to him that if he tells the teacher he won't play with my son again. My son is too young to understand playground politics yet I think but can't get away from this boy and the other children won't play with my son now as they all think he is J's friend.

I know I can't choose his friends, but I wish I could help. Today we had a friend round to play from his class which was ok but this friend said that he doesn't play with my son at school because he is always with J.

Should I speak to the teacher?

clare O(91),"Hi all Yesterday my 12 year old came out of school in tears. She hangs around with 6 girls all in her form and one of the girls India who is a right cow as started picking on her. She is sort of the leader of the group and the other girls who are supposed to be my daughters friends are following suit. Earlier on in the week they stole my daughters shoes off her feet and ran off with them and put them in the lost property at school. She then had to walk through school ion her socks to lost property to get them back. She got told off by the lady in the office for messing around:shock: Bethany (my daughter) said that her socks were soaked from walking without her shoes and the group thought this highly amusing! Then yesterday another girl from the group jess took Bethany's mobile out the inside of her blazer pocket during a lesson with out Bethany's knowledge and gave it to India. THen later on at lunch time Bethany said I can't find my phone. They then started saying &#034;Your mums going to be so mad with you when you have to go home and say you've lost your phone etc etc.&#034; They then said &#034;You had better got to lost property to see if it's been handed in&#034; So off Bethany goes and the receptionist asks &#034;what is wrong with you in one week you loose your shoes and now your phone! But your phone is not here&#034; Bethany gets worried and thinks she's ost it. they all start laughing and Bethany realises they have it. But they just deny it and carry on winding her up for the rest of the day. Then last thing Bethany catches India popping the phone bak into her pocket. They all just laugh and run off. She gets in the car in tears. None of the other girls in the group are sticking up for her, they are just letting India do this! I phoned India's mum I was polite and said I'm not sure why this is going on and this girls mum said, it's just a joke Bethany is obviously over sensitive and needs to learn to get on with the others. So I rang the school and spoke to the head of Bethanys year who said that how Bethany was treated is not nice and she will speak to the girls and tell them to all get along no more taking things. Now none of the group will talk to her and she's alone at lunch time and in class they all ignore her! She doesn't want to go to school. What should i do now?

Now things have changed, and I have the social services involved in our enviroment.

I have been told I have to make my daughter attend nursery 5 days a week,my daughter has only turned 4.

When my daughter expresses her feelings that she does not wish to go nursery, I have to tell her, she has to go, this being after prompting her with the wonderful day she will have!!
When I say, she has to go, my daughter gets upset, and inturn, when she finished nursery, I ask her did she have a Nice day, she says no, and doesnt say much about her day.


And the fact that she knows she has to go, what am I meant to do, when she is refusing to go nursery, in the end I feel pushed to explaine to her she has to go nursery

C H86slh,"Schools don’t do jack about bullying. I’m a 30 year old woman and had to put up with bullying from the time I was in 4th grade all the way through the rest of school. I was threatened with physical/sexual violence, pushed around, slapped, called names and even had school projects sabotaged. My parents would be at school all the time trying to get the bullying stopped, and this was in the 90’s. The school counselors were a joke. Nothing was ever done, but I was always told to tell an adult when it happened. I would come home with lists of things sometimes two or three sheets long.

My dad’s reaction after it went on for years and years?

“Well, YOU must have done something to make them come after you.”

That made me stop reporting the issue because somehow it was my fault and complaining never did any good anyway. I went through school hating every ounce of myself and feeling like I had no self worth. I thought about and still think about suicide from time to time because I’m unable to work, I have no self esteem and the sensory issues I have make holding a job impossible(I’m on SSI). I have problems with anxiety that I don’t talk about because to this day I still believe my feelings aren’t important enough to mention.

Right now I’m being cyber bullied by people from a cruel website I won’t name because that will just give them more ammunition to harass me. They will probably find this and use it against me. And once again nothing I have done has stopped these people from harassing me. They had my best pieces of fanworks removed from sites and I’m at a point where I don’t know who I can even trust anymore. I have a circle of online friends I know are “safe” but anybody new I keep at arm’s length; I never know who might be one of those trolls posing as a “friend” to get more information to use against me.

I feel as if the world is always judging everything I do, hoping I fail. I have never loved myself as a person and always feel like I’m not worth anything. I’m crying as I type this.

I. Have. No. Worth.

Everything I say gets twisted against me. Is my only purpose in the world to be a punching bag for every jerk who likes to bully?

STANDING UP TO IT DOES NOTHING. IT JUST MAKES THEM LAUGH HARDER!Schools don’t do jack about bullying. I’m a 30 year old woman and had to put up with bullying from the time I was in 4th grade all the way through the rest of school. I was threatened with physical/sexual violence, pushed around, slapped, called names and even had school projects sabotaged. My parents would be at school all the time trying to get the bullying stopped, and this was in the 90’s. The school counselors were a joke. Nothing was ever done, but I was always told to tell an adult when it happened. I would come home with lists of things sometimes two or three sheets long.My dad’s reaction after it went on for years and years?“Well, YOU must have done something to make them come after you.”That made me stop reporting the issue because somehow it was my fault and complaining never did any good anyway. I went through school hating every ounce of myself and feeling like I had no self worth. I thought about and still think about suicide from time to time because I’m unable to work, I have no self esteem and the sensory issues I have make holding a job impossible(I’m on SSI). I have problems with anxiety that I don’t talk about because to this day I still believe my feelings aren’t important enough to mention.Right now I’m being cyber bullied by people from a cruel website I won’t name because that will just give them more ammunition to harass me. They will probably find this and use it against me. And once again nothing I have done has stopped these people from harassing me. They had my best pieces of fanworks removed from sites and I’m at a point where I don’t know who I can even trust anymore. I have a circle of online friends I know are “safe” but anybody new I keep at arm’s length; I never know who might be one of those trolls posing as a “friend” to get more information to use against me.I feel as if the world is always judging everything I do, hoping I fail. I have never loved myself as a person and always feel like I’m not worth anything. I’m crying as I type this.I. Have. No. Worth.Everything I say gets twisted against me. Is my only purpose in the world to be a punching bag for every jerk who likes to bully?STANDING UP TO IT DOES NOTHING. IT JUST MAKES THEM LAUGH HARDER!",12,"4,354", 13-09-2010 at 3.20AM  
Debbie J(13),"I am at the end of my tether. My daughter who is 6 was a happy go lucky. confident little girl, but now she crys, is withdrawn and does not want to go to school.


I am very good friends with her mum so makes it a very arkward situation. 

The school are aware but not doing anything...

DD gets called names, was pushed up against a wall and kicked and i told her to play with other kids, the girl in question whispers in other kids ears, don't play with her.

Physical, mental and verbal bullying. But now DD is so oversensitive and emotional that every little word this kid says she bursts into tears. I have emailed school today requesting a meeting but heard nothing yet.

I understand this kid has issues but this is not acceptable behaviour. Its affecting my DD big time. i have spoke with the mum too but she does not know what to do about it, and the school seem oblivious to do anything. Monitoring is not helping my daughter who obviously is not a happy girl anymore. She wakes up sobbing in the night and today she said she felt sick and did not want to go to school. 

What do i do? Shall i take her out of school? I have bipolar and things like this have a habit of making me over worry and going ott..Please can anyone offer advise:confused:I am at the end of my tether.

ame15imj,"I dont usually post, but felt I needed to look to see if I could get any ideas on how to help my 5 year old, I wouldnt say she's being bullied as such, nothing phyiscal, but mind games and intimidation. I cannot believe how many other children it's happening to, they're all so young, what are their parents doing in bringing them up to be so unkind to others? I'm really worried that my confident, happy little girl who loves school is turning into a child who'e questioning her place in the world at her age? She has gone right through playgroup with this girl and wants to be her friend, but she's not letting her play with the other girls she wants to, asking her to get involved in fights(!) which,thankfully, she is saying no, but for how long? I've spoken to her teacher and am confident that she is doing what she can, putting them in different groups,that way she doesnt feel guilty that she's not playing with her, they're doing work about being friends, have made friendship wall etc so I'm quite happy with how school are dealing with it, I just feel helpless when she's beating herself up about not being good enough. 
I just feel so sorry for all these little children, new to school, new to being out in the world on their own and having to put up with these little brats, what kind of world are we living in. 
Well, rant over, lets hope that it'll make them stronger in the long term.I dont usually post, but felt I needed to look to see if I could get any ideas on how to help my 5 year old, I wouldnt say she's being bullied as such, nothing phyiscal, but mind games and intimidation.

Susie B(116),"Hello,
I took my 3 yr old son to a playcentre with some friends and their sons yesterday. One of the other sons who is rather lively smacked my son and made him cry. The mum told her son that he shouldn't do this and then a discussion began between us (me and friends) about what you do in this situation.

To my horror, two of the mums openly said that if their child gets hit or smacked they tell them they must do it back so they don't get bullied. Although I do understand this rationale, I have spent my son's life so far instilling in him that you do NOT smack, hit, bite or scratch others, so why on earth would I now start telling him that it's ok in this situation? Surely, this reasoning is what causes children to be violent towards each other in the first place?

Someone help me with what to do because although I think this is very wrong, I also don't want my (rather timid) son to become a victim of bullying.Hello,I took my 3 yr old son to a playcentre with some friends and their sons yesterday.

I am seeing the school tomorow and i have contacted the education authority and i was told by law i have to put my son in the school as he is not allowed to have unauthorised absence or they will fine me can anyone tell me what they would do in this situation i have a child who can hardly turn his neck when he goes in the shower he screams in pain he has purple bruising all over his shoulder i have taken him to the doctors and all has been documented i used to think when u send your children to school they should feel safe and welcome i would be grateful for peoples feedback.Good Afternoon I really Sympathise with your situation I am currently going through the same kind of issues with my son he is 8 on Tuesday and i have pulled him out of school until i get some answers i am disgusted that at this age they can suffer such physical and verbal bullying it is disgraceful my son is also very sensitive many incidents have happened and the school have passed it off as an accident but the last and final straw was for me on the first day of term two incidents occurred at lunch time a child took a tennis racket and smashed it on my sons fingers and as he was running away he smacked this tennis racket full pelt on my sons shoulder blade as he continued running in pain to go and tell the teacher who was miles away and not really supervising two boys grabbed my son and he has an alipisha patch he has had since birth which is a very sensitive area they wiped dirty rain water from  the bench and smacked it into my child's head my son finally got to the teacher and the teacher gave this child who took it upon himself to strike my son with a tennis racket a YELLOW CARD which is a warning and he will loose 5 mins playtime what the hell is this world coming to.I am seeing the school tomorow and i have contacted the education authority and i was told by law i have to put my son in the school as he is not allowed to have unauthorised absence or they will fine me can anyone tell me what they would do in this situation i have a child who can hardly turn his neck when he goes in the shower he screams in pain he has purple bruising all over his shoulder i have taken him to the doctors and all has been documented i used to think when u send your children to school they should feel safe and welcome i would be grateful for peoples feedback.",2,"2,720", 09-01-2011 at 2.35PM  
Valerie G(38),"Hi has anyone any advice please. My son has just started secondary school and wants to catch the school bus along with his friends. Unfortunately there is one boy in particular who came from a different primary school who seems to have it in for my son and his friends. He calls names, threatens to get them and punches them, takes the school bags and emptys them all on the bus. My son can be quite sensitive but was trying to handle it himself. He tried punching back - which is unusual for him - but the boy just punches back harder, he tries not to sit near him and ignores him but the boy simply moves closer as others get off. I've spoken to the school, as have other parents about this boy, and they have banned him from going upstairs on the bus but he still goes up there. Apparently he is with an older boy who is &#034;really hard&#034; and that is why everyone is scared to stand up for each other. I expect some messing about on a school bus, kids without supervision usually do, but when my son comes home with bruises from being punched it is not funny. I have started to pick him up myself this week, but i just feel that the bully has won and is still getting the bus and my son can't.Hi has anyone any advice please.  My son has just started secondary school and wants to catch the school bus along with his friends.  Unfortunately there is one boy in particular who came from a different primary school who seems to have it in for my son and his friends.  He calls names, threatens to get them and punches them, takes the school bags and emptys them all on the bus.  My son can be quite sensitive but was trying to handle it himself.  He tried punching back - which is unusual for him - but the boy just punches back harder, he tries not to sit near him and ignores him but the boy simply moves closer as others get off.  I've spoken to the school, as have other parents about this boy, and they have banned him from going upstairs on the bus but he still goes up there.  Apparently he is with an older boy who is ""really hard"" and that is why everyone is scared to stand up for each other.  I expect some messing about on a school bus, kids without supervision usually do, but when my son comes home with bruises from being punched it is not funny.

Tei92wkd,"Hi everyone, I am very upset and also don't know where to start, very confused as well.

I am not at all upset with this toddler, but with her mum. We got together so we mums can chat while our toddlers play together. However, one of the toddlers just did NOT let the other children play at all. Whatever the others were playing with, she wanted to play with the same toy. Not only pulling the toy away from the other toddlers, but also making them cry, as she kept on going until one cries!

She made my daughter cry so hard that she had left the room and I went after her and find her on the floor, covering her face just bursting into tears. My child is not an agressive child but also not weak at all. She is assertive, she loves sharing and giving, of course there is times when she doesn't want to share, then I come along and encourage her to share with others, and let the others take turns. This is what I see most other mums do, apart from today. This mum was just not getting up or doing or saying anything at all to this child to stop it. She was going around the room, taking everyones toys away, making them cry. If I was her mum, I would be soooo embarrased!!! and would be so upset that my child was causing this bad environment. However, the mum sat there, did absolutely NOTHING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I am just so shocked and also disgusted, how would you let your child do this to other kids, and also how can you sit there and do nothing while the other kids and mums are upset about what has been happening! 

well, she did say at the start that my child always keeps taking toys away from other kids, and she just wants to play with whatever the other kids playing with.... does this make the whole thing okay??!!!! just because you made us aware of it, you can't just sit there and watch!!! and let things get out of hand..... 

I ended up leaving as so many times I told her mum to interrupt or do or say somethign about it to its own child, she just ignored.... I left the place but felt so sorry for my daughter, who was willing to play with others.......

I didn't want to come home, as I knew I would cry, then I drove a while, but cried the whole time, for my daughter not to see it I turned up the music so high so she wont hear my cry so hard.... this is not fear, and I am so upset with this mum, I made the decision not to come along to the meetings if she is going, didnt' tell the other mums but this is my decisionHi everyone, I am very upset and also don't know where to start, very confused as well.I am not at all upset with this toddler, but with her mum.

Kelly B(653),"Hi all, I'm new to this site and only just came across it by accident looking for a sausage pasta recipe!

My son is 11 next month and a very big boy for his age. He's already wearing mens clothes! As big as he is, he is very sensitive and quiet. He much prefers to be the joker than anything else. 
Being as big as he is though, he is putting on some weight (which I've noticed over the last few months but wasn't worried about until now)
1 of his so called friends has started a daily ritual of calling him fat and hitting him. My boy is big as I say but very much a gentle giant. I've told him a number of times if someone hits him to hit them back but he wont, cos every time he does, it's him who gets caught and gets into trouble.

I have spoken to the school about it but all I ever get told is that my son needs to toughen up a bit! 

I try and reassure him that he isn't fat, it's just puppy weight and will turn into muscle but he's so upset by this everyday and my heart bleeds for him.

He comes home on his own now so I never see this child or his parent to say anything.

Any suggestions??

I try and reassure him that he isn't fat, it's just puppy weight and will turn into muscle but he's so upset by this everyday and my heart bleeds for him.He comes home on his own now so I never see this child or his parent to say anything.Any suggestions??Kelly  ",4,"4,410", 08-11-2010 at 6.00PM

bec38rsj,"My 7 year old son has been having problems with his best pal since they started primary school together. My son and his friend are both bright, have big personalities, they both like to lead in games and are very competative. I understand that personalites clash.

Gra75uwv,"My dd is 8 and is an only child. Her best friend outside school is a 13 years old girl whose mum is a good friend of my. We meet up often at weekends and the two girls play nicely together. My dd absolutely worships her best friend.

However, on a few occasions in the past when girls similar to my dd’s age or slightly older joined them to play, I noticed this older girl completely ignored my dd so some times my dd was left on her own and was upset. I always explained to my dd that if she wanted to keep her best friend she needs to be considerate and generous towards her and not being possessive because it was natural that her best friend wanted to play with girls closer to her age or with girls she didn’t see very often. 

Both my dd and her older best friend were invited to another girl’s house yesterday. The other girl is 10 and her mum is also a good friend of my. I noticed again the other two girls seemed hurdled together most of the time and my dd was upset. I asked her if she wanted to go home and she said no so we stayed to the end. On our way home my dd said her best friend commented something she said was stupid, constantly picked on things she said or did and returned the best friend bracelet that my dd gave her - all these happened in front of the other girl. My dd didn’t understand why her best friend who played nicely with her only a few days ago became so mean to her.

Should I do anything or simply tell my daughter to toughen up? My instinct tells me never to bring my dd to a group of girls again when this older girl will be there. I have no problem that this older girl wants to play with other girls rather my dd in a group situation, but she now seems enjoy picking on my dd, putting her down, seeing her upset and feeling her power over the others.

He is now in the juniors and is in the exactly same class as he was before so knows all the children, his teacher is umm nice but this is her first class and i feel the class can get a bit roudy at times (i have been in to help) well last week we had a parents evening even though they had only been there 4 weeks, it all started well she said she had no concerns he was doing well with his work and that hes very helpfull and kind....and then she hit me with it, she told me 2 parents had come in to say my son had upset their children, i was angey and upset as i know my son and he just isnt like that she said that my son had been getting bossy with them and upset them...is this bullying??

She then told me who it was (she probably shouldnt hav don that) but it was the boy who my son had had problems with in infants and his best friend, which made me even angrier for 2 reasons firstly this child and his older brother (also in the school) are constantly bullying others (i once witnessed this child slap his mum across the face and she did nothing) and are not the sort to be bullied, and that there parent didnt just talk to me about it, they know me we talk, (althought to be honest we are the complete opposite)so i then left in a bit of a daze as to what had happened i spoke to my so who got upset and said that infact the child and his brother had been bullyin him and he told the teacher but she didnt do anything (he couldnt think of any incident with the other child)

The question is what do i do now i know my son is no bully, infact when i told a few close friends (who also have children in the class)they were in shock, i dont want to make a big deal but i also dont want my son branded a bully

Deleted profile,"My son goes to a good school, mostly nice children and nice teachers- minus the &#034;odd&#034; one.
I have every faith in them to tackle this problem i just need to get it off my chest!!



I am fuming. During the last year (yr 1) my son has been coming home with the odd tale of the odd nasty comments, something i would expect in a school.

He is in year 2 now, the kids are bigger and nastier and more aware of friendships and how to gang up.


Today he was playing with a yr 1 pupil -as he always plays with the younger kids as i don't think the kids in his year are really interested in him type of games- 

 Anyway he was running and accidentally bumped into one of the boys who sometimes picks on him ---anyone else bumped into this boy he would have ignored, but not with my son--- This boy seized his chance then got his other two mates to join in, they told him to &#034;hit him in the face&#034;, but he said &#034;no i will hit him in the nose&#034;. And he did. 

My son explained in his innocent way of speaking how he didn't like the &#034;sweet taste in his mouth&#034;. His nose was bleeding. 

I rang the school when he left and i spoke to his teacher. She said the boys had been sent to the head teacher and got a telling off. She will speak to him fully tonight and speak to DH after school tomorrow about it. I will be going with him too.
They had not told us about the incident, it was up to our son to tell us.

A few of the gang members have received invitations for my sons party, one told him it was &#034;rubbish and he wasn't going&#034; and another said he had &#034;ripped it up&#034;.

Most of the class - the more popular ones- are decent lads, they are friendly with no ego problems. They are coming to the party and he is always invited to theirs. He just isn't &#034;matey mates&#034; with them at school.

I am fuming though, i feel like giving them what for, in fact on friday i did just that to one boy at home as he lives nearby, and the girl he was with had actually told me that this boy had just told her he had shown my son his willy, to which he denied but why is he making these stories up, they are a bunch of idiots! This boy said sorry and asked my son to play, how long dif that last!

Sha29qtt,Hi - I hope someone can give me some advice on the best way to move forward on this bullying issue. My daughter is 7 and is being bullied by one of the boys in her class. He calls her names and tells her she is rubbish at doing things and that her work is rubbish or wrong. She has had to sit next to him class so he is picking on her during class and at playtimes. Her 2 best friends are boys and she plays tennis or basketball with them at play time. The boy who is bullying her is also friends with her friends but doesn't want to play with girls. I have spoken to this boys mum and initially she was supportive but now she just says that he is no longer doing anything and that it isn't just her son who doesn't want to play with my duaghter. i know this is not true because I have heard the other boys asking her to bring her tennis racket to play with them the next day or asking her if she wants to play basketball tomorrow. Also she says one of her friends is telling the bully to leave her alone. i have also spoken to my daughter's teacher who said she would speak to both children. At least she has now moved my daughter to another desk so she doesn't have to sit next to this boy anymore. Do I just keep complaining to the school and sending my daughter in even though she is crying and not sleeping and worrying that she will get in trouble if she tells on the bully. I hate this situation and don't know what to do next.Hi - I hope someone can give me some advice on the best way to move forward on this bullying issue.  My daughter is 7 and is being bullied by one of the boys in her class.  He calls her names and tells her she is rubbish at doing things and that her work is rubbish or wrong.  She has had to sit next to him class so he is picking on her during class and at playtimes.  Her 2 best friends are boys and she plays tennis or basketball with them at play time.  The boy who is bullying her is also friends with her friends but doesn't want to play with girls.  I have spoken to this boys mum and initially she was supportive but now she just says that he is no longer doing anything and that it isn't just her son who doesn't want to play with my duaghter.  i know this is not true because I have heard the other boys asking her to bring her tennis racket to play with them the next day or asking her if she wants to play basketball tomorrow.  Also she says one of her friends is telling the bully to leave her alone.  i have also spoken to my daughter's teacher who said she would speak to both children.  At least she has now moved my daughter to another desk so she doesn't have to sit next to this boy anymore.  Do I just keep complaining to the school and sending my daughter in even though she is crying and not sleeping and worrying that she will get in trouble if she tells on the bully.  I hate this situation and don't know what to do next.,4,"2,769", 06-10-2010 at 5.37PM  
Jan29gcn,Asked my son how his evening at cadets had gone and he said it was great as he had made a deal with another cadet of the same age (10). The boy agreed to stop hitting him on condition he coughed up money. My son was so happy but I had to tell him that was something he could not do and I would have to go and talk to the officer in charge at the unit. My son has already told some older cadets that this boy has been hitting him and they have apparently talked to the boy but obviously it is still continuing. Any ideas how to get throught this.

kar82fxb,"I'm posting this to give you hope and courage to stand up for your child with their school if they are being bullied. If need be, DO NOT keep making them go to school if you know it is already making them ill. That is the worse thing you can do and the school will not do much about it if they know you will still send your child to school. You need to take dramatic action and now. If it's possible pull them out of school and put them in another school. If need be, teach them at home for a while. Their mental health depends on it.

Up until a couple of months ago I Home Edded my son for 6 years from the age of 8 (he's now 14) due to severe bullying at his primary school from both the other kids and the teachers who also picked on him. It made him ill as a result. The school wouldn't help me and so I pulled him out of school. I was told not to expect any help at all from the school or the LEA so I never did. 

All I know is I gave the school a bright confident happy child and they gave me back a damaged one who lost all his self confidence and became very depressed and developed major tics to his eyes, neck and head. He also developed a fear of other kids and adults in general.

Home Edding was the best decision I have ever made in my life and it gave me back my son.

Most people I would come across were very supportive of me Home Edding. I did come across one or two who kept going on about the socialisation issue (yawn). This was always a problem for others who don't or won't understand Home Edding but never for us. 

One mum was so angry at me, I can remember standing there and watching her mouth open and close while she was venting her anger at me and telling me how much my son was missing out. I remember thinking how ignorant she was and how she knew nothing at all about the reason why I was Home Edding and about Home Edding in general, so she was clearly making the situation all about herself and in fact it had nothing to do with us.

Six years on we moved to a completely new area and now my son is at an outstanding secondary school which I chose carefully and went through two school appeals to get as there was a waiting list like there is with all the good schools. 

He has settled in amazingly well without any issues whasoever and he is very happy there and every day he looks forward to going to school. Academically he is way ahead of his peers and his classmates accepted him as one of them from the first day he started.

The teachers are fab and say it is as if he has been there for years. 

This isn't me boasting about how well it's all turned out for us but I want to give you all hope, courage and inspiration to stand up for your child. I know how traumatic it is and how helpless you feel when your child is being bullied. I hope my experience will give you hope that with some courage and determination your child will also have a happy ending.I'm posting this to give you hope and courage to stand up for your child with their school if they are being bullied. If need be, DO NOT keep making them go to school if you know it is already making them ill. That is the worse thing you can do and the school will not do much about it if they know you will still send your child to school. You need to take dramatic action and now. If it's possible pull them out of school and put them in another school. If need be, teach them at home for a while. Their mental health depends on it.Up until a couple of months ago I Home Edded my son for 6 years from the age of 8 (he's now 14) due to severe bullying at his primary school from both the other kids and the teachers who also picked on him. It made him ill as a result. The school wouldn't help me and so I pulled him out of school. I was told not to expect any help at all from the school or the LEA so I never did. All I know is I gave the school a bright confident happy child and they gave me back a damaged one who lost all his self confidence and became very depressed and developed major tics to his eyes, neck and head. He also developed a fear of other kids and adults in general.Home Edding was the best decision I have ever made in my life and it gave me back my son.Most people I would come across were very supportive of me Home Edding. I did come across one or two who kept going on about the socialisation issue (yawn). This was always a problem for others who don't or won't understand Home Edding but never for us. One mum was so angry at me, I can remember standing there and watching her mouth open and close while she was venting her anger at me and telling me how much my son was missing out. I remember thinking how ignorant she was and how she knew nothing at all about the reason why I was Home Edding and about Home Edding in general, so she was clearly making the situation all about herself and in fact it had nothing to do with us.Six years on we moved to a completely new area and now my son is at an outstanding secondary school which I chose carefully and went through two school appeals to get as there was a waiting list like there is with all the good schools. He has settled in amazingly well without any issues whasoever and he is very happy there and every day he looks forward to going to school. Academically he is way ahead of his peers and his classmates accepted him as one of them from the first day he started.The teachers are fab and say it is as if he has been there for years. This isn't me boasting about how well it's all turned out for us but I want to give you all hope, courage and inspiration to stand up for your child. I know how traumatic it is and how helpless you feel when your child is being bullied. I hope my experience will give you hope that with some courage and determination your child will also have a happy ending.",5,"11,033", 25-07-2010 at 5.13PM

Michelle M(362),"Ok, I will try and be as brief as possible.

My son is 9. Up until May he had a large circle of friends then 1 boy started to be horribe to him and try and get him in a fight which was odd because they had been friends a long time. He started saying to my son that he thought he was better than everyone else. Anyway, my son seemed to be handing this as it was just one boy but now if my son is with this crowd, they all start picking on him calling him names and saying that he goes on baby websites and stuff like that. My son is old for his age, probably more like a 12/13 year old.

When he is with these &#034;friends&#034; on their own, everything is OK but when they all get together the problem starts. Even one of his best friends is fine and then gets with the group and it all goes pear shaped.

Another friend has stuck by my son but now the others have started on him aswell.

My son wont let me do anything about it and because it happens mostly out of school, I'm not sure whether the school would be interested or be able to help?

I really want to speak to the parents of the boy who started it but my son said that would be embarrassing and my OH said that he agrees with my son.

My son seems OK in general just a little upset and angry sometimes.

Help, what should I do? I dont really get many replies on netmums but I really need some help.

Deleted profile,"Hi
Ive posted this in the bullying bit as i was trying to find a schools bit but didnt know where to post this so please move it if it wrong section.

A bit of history...My son made a friend at preschool last term and they have been inseperable (sp?) always playing together. Well about 2 weeks ago i was at his friends house with him when they had an arguement over some crayons. They were his friends 'special' crayons. (all children have there fave things, this boys was his crayons)
Well his friend told him to go home and my son wanted to come home but me and this boys mum made them carry on playing together but they kept fighting so i came home.

Since then DS has been saying he dont like XXX anymore and dosnt want to play at his house, so i thought fair enough.

Took him to preschool this morning, he was dragging his heels saying he didnt want to go.
Got in and he said 'hello XXX' to be answered back with 'Go away i dont want to talk to you' :shock:My son was upset so i told him to go up to him and say he wants to be friends again. His answer he got back was 'i dont like you go away' So i then told him to go play with X another boy he got on with. He went up to X and said 'will you play with me today' for X to respond 'Your a horrible boy you take things off people!' My son then came over to me all upset saying nobody wanted to be his friend.:tear:
His keyworker came over and asked what was wrong so i told her about what X had said. She called him over and made him say sorry but he still didnt want to play with my son, which i suppose is fair enough.
It broke my heart to see how upset my son was and how nasty 2 boys could be at 3 years old!!!:tear::(
On the way out after i settled him with his keyworker the head of childcare stopped me and asked what was wrong with my DS so i told her the whole story.
She told me she wouldnt stand for that sort of behaviour in the centre and would talk to everyone today about friendships at 'carpet time'
She surprised me by saying how common it is children 'sticking together' so if one falls out they all stick together to exclude the other.
I know all children fall out, but usually make friends again pretty quickly so im not naive.
The head of childcare told me there was a group of girls in last years morning session that she actually said were little madams and did the whole 'talk to the hand' attitude:shock: and were horrible to other children. She said they get like this younger and younger now:shock:

Im hoping when i get him later its all been sorted out.
Im not best pals with the boys mum, just been invited round for coffee when the kids have played so on speaking terms. She seems to think it will blow over and dosnt think there is a problem. I dont feel i could ask her to have a word with her son. I know if he dosnt want o be m8s thats fair enough but maybe a word to say be nice and say hello maybe?

I was expecting all this over the next few years, falling out, and perhaps bullying...but not now at 3 years old!HiIve posted this in the bullying bit as i was trying to find a schools bit but didnt know where to post this so please move it if it wrong section.A bit of history...My son made a friend at preschool last term and they have been inseperable (sp?) always playing together.

He is a very sensitive child and really takes things to heart. He is not the most athletic child and the other children take advantage of this. When they are playing they always pick him to 'be on it' as they think he can't run as fast as them. He finds this hurtful and gets annoyed but it only makes them do it more.

I thought I'd start a new thread on this subject after reading the others posted here...especially Colette's post asking: 



Maybe if we can look into why/how a child (or anyone) becomes a bully, we can begin to understand how to tackle bullying, i.e. we need to deal with the cause as well as the symptoms of bullying. 

Just telling a bully to stop bullying isn't going to work. If they stop bullying one child, they may then go on to bully another. Imho, we need to understand (and address if possible) what is going on in the bully's life in order to stop them bullying. 

I'm not trying to be 'politically correct', but maybe we can spare a thought for parents who visit this board looking for help/advice because their child is a bully.

Does anyone have any views on this as a solution.

Carolyn M(101),"My son has been bullied almost daily since he started senior school a year and a half ago. It is a group of about six lads who take it in turns - when one gets into trouble for it, a couple of the others take over.

Two of the ringleaders were finally internally excluded today, not just taken off timetable..this goes on their permanent record. It didn't stop the third picking on his best mate today, knowing they would both be upset. 

The last day of last half-term, one was urging him to commit suicide. He's only 12 and not surprisingly doesn't want to go to school.

His new Head of Year has called me today and her suggestion is that my son change groups, giving him a whole new set of teachers, classes and different boys, a couple of whom he gets on well with.

He would also have to change his foreign language to another one after 18 months of study. Her reasoning is that it is too complicated to move the three ringleaders and they are all in the German class, whereas all the other groups do French.

He would have to leave all his friends in the core subjects, although they are not in his stream for maths or science, he is way above them.

Should he have to move? Any teachers out there, what are the likely effects on his emotional wellbeing and his education?

Any thoughts please ladies? Can't sleep, I'm so worried - he is torn between wanting it to change and not wanting to lose his friends - his best mate moved schools last term and he still misses him.My son has been bullied almost daily since he started senior school a year and a half ago.  It is a group of about six lads who take it in turns - when one gets into trouble for it, a couple of the others take over.Two of the ringleaders were finally internally excluded today, not just taken off timetable..this goes on their permanent record.  It didn't stop the third picking on his best mate today, knowing they would both be upset.

This could be his sensitivity picking up on things that children say as he comes home and 'tell tales' a lot, saying people are calling him names and swearing. When questioned, it turns out theyve done no more than call him an idiot. My son also exaggerates the truth a lot and dare i say it, lies. Not everything he says can be took at face value and i resent myself saying that.I think im just hoping what he said this time about the incident with the older lads is true and he hasnt exaggerated in anyway.

Jo-70iit,"I am having real problems with my 4year old son at the moment.

At Christmas he began acting aggressively and downright nastily. For example if his sister tripped he’d stand over her saying ha ha in her face. It sounds small but he wouldn't normally have been that mean. He was forever on the naughty step and I felt like I was constantly pulling him up about his behaviour. 

I put it down to the fact that he was at nursery and as it is part of a school he was playing with older boys and may be becoming a bit more outspoken as a result.

At the xmas fayre a group of reception girls told me he was always being hurt and I told his nursery teacher and she said she'd watch it. He has since told me someone is hurting him but doesn't ever say a name or give any details so I let it go. When I told his teacher the other day she said she hadn’t seen anything and I think she’s forgotten what I told her at Xmas 

A few weeks ago his behaviour started getting really bad so we turned Ben 10 off in case it was that, but nothing changed. He then started to get teary when I dropped him off at nursery and last week he was inconsolable, running out after me so that the teachers had to literally drag him back in. I decided if he did it again I would bring him back home with me. He did it the next day so we went home. It took the rest of that day and the next but over half term has gone back to his old self and is fantastic to have around again.

I didn't think taking him home early was too much of an issue as he's still in nursery (he was 4 in Feb). I can't keep him off once he starts school, and I don't know if I've made a rod for my own back and he might pull this stunt again to stay home when he is older.

I'm confused….. is he being bullied or just missing me? His sister is in nursery and she likes it - she went in without him last week. She also says someone hurts him. I am not saying that I don't believe them but I did once read that they could be having a fab day and one thing goes wrong and it clouds the entire day and it's all they remember and talk about. 

Therefore I wanted to watch and see what happened and see if I could get more details out of them before I made a complaint. Have I waited too long? Is it just a small boy trying to find his feet and coming up against bigger boys that play too rough? (there is nursery to year 2 in his playground). I'm so confused, all suggestions greatfully received!!I am having real problems with my 4year old son at the moment.At Christmas he began acting aggressively and downright nastily. For example if his sister tripped he’d stand over her saying ha ha in her face. It sounds small but he wouldn't normally have been that mean. He was forever on the naughty step and I felt like I was constantly pulling him up about his behaviour. I put it down to the fact that he was at nursery and as it is part of a school he was playing with older boys and may be becoming a bit more outspoken as a result.At the xmas fayre a group of reception girls told me he was always being hurt and I told his nursery teacher and she said she'd watch it. He has since told me someone is hurting him but doesn't ever say a name or give any details so I let it go. When I told his teacher the other day she said she hadn’t seen anything and I think she’s forgotten what I told her at Xmas A few weeks ago his behaviour started getting really bad so we turned Ben 10 off in case it was that, but nothing changed. He then started to get teary when I dropped him off at nursery and last week he was inconsolable, running out after me so that the teachers had to literally drag him back in. I decided if he did it again I would bring him back home with me. He did it the next day so we went home.

Hel52ddv,"MY DS is 3 and at pre school every morning. I drop him off every morning, take him in and wave good bye. This morning whilst we were waiting to go in he was playing in the pre school play ground. He approached a set of twin boys and said &#034; do you want to play Ben 10?&#034; both boys then started shouting at him saying &#034; we don't like Ben 10...we don't like you...we don't want to play with you...&#034; My Ds then came back to me and had a cuddle. He then went back to the boys and said &#034; what do you want to play?&#034; the two boys then backed him into a corner and both started kicking him really hard. I obviously ran over and pulled him away. He was really shaken, and i was stunned to see such viciuos behaviour from such young children. Then mother of the boys was also in the playground and didn't even acknowledge what they had done. (i am unsure if she saw, she was talking with some other mums). 

DS went into pre school quite happy in the end, but i am now going over and over the incident in my head. It was so horrible to see children do that to my son. I wish i had said something to the mother but was so caught up in looking after DS i didn't. Should i call pre school and let them know what has happened, just to make sure it hasn't continued after i left?

my 5 year old son came home from school yesterday upset saying that no-one wants to be his friend and he always has to play on his own at playtime. He also said there is a boy in his class who keeps pushing him. I was so shocked i could sense he was upset as when i drop him off he never likes to go and get in the line and he always looks sad as i wave him off and the odd occasions his said he doesn't want to go to school but this has broken my heart! he was sitting there saying that maybe he can say to the boys haha you can't play with us and that maybe that will work for them to be his friend! His asked if he can go to a new school and make new friends and i've told him we'll see.

I spoke to his teacher this morning and she said she wasn't aware of this and its probably down to settling back in from the school holidays and that she will sit the class down and ask 'who is Alfie's friend?' and 'who wants to play with Alfie?'!! Now to me i see that as singling him out to all the children and if nobody puts their hand up my poor son has to sit there and watch!! I also spoke to her about the boy who keeps pushing him and she was aware of this and had spoken to the boy... but never informed me about this and she said its happened on a few occasions!

I'm going to speak to him after school and see how it went but if nothing changes i don't know what to do. my other 2 children are due to start peception/nursery there in January too. I didn't even want to take him to school today cos all i can think about is him upset at playtime and all alone.hiyamy 5 year old son came home from school yesterday upset saying that no-one wants to be his friend and he always has to play on his own at playtime.

Hul05usp,"Hi There,
I was hoping someone could give me some advice regarding my son and his school.

I will try to keep it short as possible but I doubt it will be so apologies.

My son is nearly 8 and for a year now he has been bullied by a child from his school. This other boy was in the same class as my son when they were in year 2 and after a few incidents, I spoke to my son's teacher about this child.

Not long after my son being kicked and pushed by this child, the childs grandmother pulled me up in the street and started shouting abuse at me as my son didn't invite her grandson to his birthday. This really scared my son and as an adult, I remained calm and told this woman that her grandson and my son had fallen out and that he had hurt my son. That was not the end of it. She stole papers from my son's teacher at parents evening which had information regarding the bullying. She nearly attacked me in the street. She screamed vile abuse at me for over 45 minutes and threatened me.

But because I was scared, i did not go to the police. I reported it to the school and I also told this grandmother that the incidents on the paper she had, was not my son and it was another child, which it was. The school did nothing to help me. I had to put up with being bad mouthed to other parents, she constantly intimidated me even though i did not show I was scared to my son.

But the boy continued hurting my son. In the end I told my son's teacher that I would take my son out of the school as I would not have my son suffering. After the summer holidays, they changed classes and this boy was in another class. However things did not improve. The grandmother continued to intimidate me and my son started running off and hiding in the shop if he saw her. I told my son not to be scared of her or him. My son was coming home with bruises and not telling me what was happening, it was only his friend who told me what had happened.

Just before xmas, the child tried to strangle my son. My son was called to the head teachers office and my son begged her not to tell the childs grandmother as he was scared she would start on us. The head told me, she would monitor the situation but within 2 weeks, the boy kicked my son so badly on his shin and foot that my son's boot penetrated his skin in 3 places and needed to go hospital.

The school was shocking in handling this. My brother phoned the school and requested a meeting with me and the head as we wanted to grandmother informed as she is the boys main carer. My son was also hysterical with crying and not wanting to go to school as he was scared. We wanted the head to be aware and try and find a solution to this. However she told me to tell my brother there was no need for a meeting and again it would be monitored. She also told me that it was my son's fault he got kicked. My son did step on the childs foots and there were other children as witnesses to prove this but the head teacher told me it was impossible that it could be an accident. I tried to tell her how frightened my son was of this child and it was recently he tried to strangle my son but she would not listen even though i told her the names of the other child who witnessed it. 

My son was then called in to her office and told to be careful were he steps next time. She also asked my son why he did not invite more people to his party which I find very unfair. Now it is coming to my son's birthday, he does not want to have a party.

To cut the story short, my son is still unhappy, its affecting his sleep and eating. My son has told my gp for many months now that he is unhappy. I have tried talking to the mentor about helping my son wanting to come to school but its been nearly 3 weeks and no one has even tried to talk to my son and help him

It is killing me inside and I do not know what else to do. I have called the council and spoken to someone in the education dep, he spoke to the school but its like I am being ignored and my son's wellbeing is not a concern. I spoke to my son's teacher 2 weeks ago and I told her again that I would take my son out immediatly if my son was hurt again. She stated that every incident would now be written and reported, yet I thought they had already done this considering I had complained since february last year.

There are no school places in any schools near me, please can someone give me sme advice, I cannot sleep at night from worry, seeing my son suffer like this at this age is wrong, he should be happy and having fun while learning in school, not being in fear of school.

Sorry I know it's long. :-(Hi There,I was hoping someone could give me some advice regarding my son and his school.I will try to keep it short as possible but I doubt it will be so apologies.My son is nearly 8 and for a year now he has been bullied by a child from his school.

Mic87zye,"Completely out of the blue yesterday, my daughter told my mother that she no longer wants to be friends with our 13 yr old neighbour as she hurts her all over her body and touches her when she doesn't want her to. 
When I learnt about it, I casually took my daughter aside and asked her what she thougt about --------. My daughter said the same thing to me that had said to my mother. I then said 'Well, nobody is allowed to hurt you - so _________ will not come to our house ever agian. 

I feel completely livid and upset by this because this girl is someone I trusted who spends a lot of time at our house and who has helped me with the kids - and has had plenty of oppurtunity to be alone with them, in a different room or whatever. 
I also feel incredibly dissapointed in myself - because in hindsight I think I can see that there were a few incidicences where this bullying might have been happening under my nose - where the neighbour has been nasty to her (by purposefully ignoring her, or leaving her out of a game or similar) and one clear occasion I can think of where the two of them were in the loounge nad my daughter cam erunning out in tears saying ______ pushed me and _____ saying 'I didn't touch her, I have no idea why she is crying.'

I feel so stupid - just last week she accompanied me and the kids on an outing to a park, and there were a few mins where she and my daughter were hiding in the bushes - which scared me like crayz, and I really shouted at them afterwards because I couldnt see them - but that incident makes me think 'why did she take my 3 yr old to the bushes?' Oh my gosh - the more I write about it, the more angry I feel. 

Any comments would be appreciated. I dont know what to do - I know she is definitely not welcome here again, but I feel like storming over there and saying something to the mother.

pam46xzq,"Hi, im so glad i found this post as im at a loss as where to go next with my almost 10 year old daughter who has been getting a really hard time for almost a year now.

we moved last april to my boyfriends area which is a totally different area and alot rougher to what my daughter was used to, she seemed to make friends really fast in and out of the school which i was happy to see, most kids stayed in a street round corner and she would go round and play with them, my daughter is tiny for her age so most people think she is about 6 and tend to baby her ie lift her cuddle her.

after a month or two i had a run in with a mother at her daughters communion it just so happened that she was my partners cousin, she is a nasty woman and her children, i thought were delightful until after this day.

since this runin, her 3 kids have punished my daughter calling her a midget and that they will hit her and send there mum round to which i said to my daughter thats fine let her try come to my door dont you worry yourself about that and ignore them, i thought it was a phase and would pass, all the other kids from street turned as well calling paige poisonous the mother even would say things to my daughter which i went mad about, this woman is unapproachable and would end up in a fight if we even seen eachn other which is totally unacceptable and im really not interested in her so i chose to let my boyfriend speak to her being her cousin. her daughter is in my daughters class but the other two kids are older ones in primary seven the other in high school so is not fair pickin on younger kids.

they tell my daughter we dont like your mum or you, you should move back to wear you came from you midget or wer going to get you, its toughened my daughter up a bit but shes so fragile i worry if they hit her as they are quite big for there age and she is tiny in comparison. i dont know what else to do, she has friends from dance class but thats in our old area she cant go to any clubs here as they all go and the mother phones and said my daughter caused trouble, if my daughter plays with ny other kid from school the mother phones theyre parents saying my daughter is trouble to which one of the parents said it sounded like a vendetta against me and my daughter was suffering against it, i want to go punch her in the face but obviosly this solves nothing but how dare she do this along with her kids, which are learning from the mother anyway, to my daughter, shes no angel but she doesnt deserve this type treatment.xHi, im so glad i found this post as im at a loss as where to go next with my almost 10 year old daughter who has been getting a really hard time for almost a year now.we moved last april to my boyfriends area which is a totally different area and alot rougher to what my daughter was used to, she seemed to make friends really fast in and out of the school which i was happy to see, most kids stayed in a street round corner and she would go round and play with them, my daughter is tiny for her age so most people think she is about 6 and tend to baby her ie lift her cuddle her.after a month or two i had a run in with a mother at her daughters communion it just so happened that she was my partners cousin, she is a nasty woman and her children, i thought were delightful until after this day.since this runin, her 3 kids have punished my daughter calling her a midget and that they will hit her and send there mum round to which i said to my daughter thats fine let her try come to my door dont you worry yourself about that and ignore them, i thought it was a phase and would pass, all the other kids from street turned as well calling paige poisonous the mother even would say things to my daughter which i went mad about, this woman is unapproachable and would end up in a fight if we even seen eachn other which is totally unacceptable and im really not interested in her so i chose to let my boyfriend speak to her being her cousin. her daughter is in my daughters class but the other two kids are older ones in primary seven the other in high school so is not fair pickin on younger kids.ive told my daughter just tell them your not interested and to go away the mothers been told that shes to stop discussing adult matters with her kids to use against my daughter, if this woman has a problem why take it out on a defencless ten year old why not just come to me myself am ready to lose my rag which ive been trying to avoid, in school is no better as theyre in her class ive phoned school and they said they play fine and i said well looks are deceiving because my daughter is being tormented.they tell my daughter we dont like your mum or you, you should move back to wear you came from you midget or wer going to get you, its toughened my daughter up a bit but shes so fragile i worry if they hit her as they are quite big for there age and she is tiny in comparison. i dont know what else to do, she has friends from dance class but thats in our old area she cant go to any clubs here as they all go and the mother phones and said my daughter caused trouble, if my daughter plays with ny other kid from school the mother phones theyre parents saying my daughter is trouble to which one of the parents said it sounded like a vendetta against me and my daughter was suffering against it, i want to go punch her in the face but obviosly this solves nothing but how dare she do this along with her kids, which are learning from the mother anyway, to my daughter, shes no angel but she doesnt deserve this type treatment.x",7,"1,563", 16-03-2010 at 9.30AM  
l m07fnf,"My son who is 4 was beat up in the playground, the two boys that did it stamped on his head and jumped on his back 
He is covered in bruises.

They did it because my DS didn't want to play there game anymore and went off to play elsewhere so they decided to 'get him'

The playground supervisor found them and they were told off by the headmistress and have had a very stern talking too.

I was not informed until I picked my son up today, he told me what happened on the way home from school, I considered turning around and going back as I was fuming but decided it was best to call them in case I lost my temper in front of DS who is already feeling sorry for himself 

I spoke to his teacher who said she didnt know I was on loudspeaker and the deputy head was in the room and said it was true and had been classed as serious.

I told her I'm unsure to bring him in as I don't feel comfortable, she said they have done all they could and are so sorry, she said my DS was in trouble the other day as he pushed one of the boys that beat him up today. She finished on saying she is going to have a 'big' word with the boys alone tomorrow and to please bring my DS in.

I'm so upset when I spoke to my DS he said he pushed the boy as he was making fun of him and he told him to stop but he ept making fun of me, but what these boys did today was completely unprovoked! I couldn't imagine a 4 year old stamping on another 4 year old's head...it just seems so wrong!

van43cdg,"I recently gave the letter below to my Son's year 3 class teacher, who said he couldn't really offer a solution and to meet with the deputy head.

Has anyone been in a similar situation, what can i expect the school to do? He has recently been diagnosed with specific language impairment which make communication very difficult. His teacher think this makes him 'different' and a target to other children.

Dear Mr......
I would be grateful if I could bring to your attention a selection of recent incidents that have caused concern with regards to my son.

A red mark on his arm, which was due to a boy in his class holding it down on a radiator in the corridor on the way to P.E. whilst another boy looked on and laughed.

A grazed bruise above his wrist which lasted for several days. Ethan was very guarded when questioned about this, but did confirm it was the same boy form the radiator incident that had inflicted the injury.

I spoke with Mr ..............about my concerns of another pupil’s demonstration of ‘bum sex’ involving my son. Which was brought to the head teachers attention.

A deep red scratch on his neck and a bruise on his eye lid. He tells me a boy from year six jumped on him during break time. The marks were substantial enough to be commented on four days after by a member if staff in breakfast club.

Returning home form school upset that year six boys had taunted and ridiculed him even to the extent they followed and cornered him in the boy’s toilets. Another pupil from my son's class witnessed this and told his mum who, perturbed, decided to find me at school home time pass this information on. Her son had witnessed the boys hit and jump on my son and unfortunately not for the first time. 

It is understandable considering the above I am feeling uneasy about my sons welfare and happiness during school hours. The above points have occurred during the current school year. There were occurrences in previous school years but not to such a physical extent.

It disturbs me that such activities seem to go unnoticed by staff; at no point during these incidents does it appear an adult has intervened. It is only through limited communication with my son (as he clams up at the mention of these events) that it has luckily been brought to my attention.

This is offensive behavior that should not be endured by any child. My son is very upset at the idea of my mentioning this to the teachers as he believes this will make things worse, this is my biggest worry, shouldn’t my child feel protected within school?I recently gave the letter below to my Son's year 3 class teacher, who said he couldn't really offer a solution and to meet with the deputy head.Has anyone been in a similar situation, what can i expect the school to do?

Cat16okf,"Hi all,

I am so upset that I am actually having to ask for advice about my son being bullied - I was bullied at school and never wanted it to happen to my boys 

My 4 1/2 twin boys are in separate classes (it is the policy at their school to split all twins - against our wishes ) and Robbie, although hating being split from Jossie at first, seems to be happy - he is doing very well academically and has good friends in his class. Jossie isn't so lucky. 

When both of the boys were in the nursery class they overheard two of the teachers referring to a little group of boys as &#034;the bully gang&#034; and that name has stuck in their minds. When they moved into reception a couple of the boys were in Jossie's class and they quickly added to the number in their group, so now there is a core group of about 5 boys(can be 8 or 9 some days). Jossie would dearly love to be accepted by this group, as he hasn't made any close friends in his class and I think he somehow seems to crave their acceptance. However they deliberately ignore him, laugh at him, leave him out of their games, refuse to talk to him and when he asks if he can play football with them they say things like &#034;you're too small&#034; (he is the smallest boy in his class, &#034;you're a baby&#034; and won't let him join in.

They have pushed and hit him (he has got bruises and scratches to prove it) and make fun of him, saying that he is silly because he has a friend who is a girl. One one occasion they pushed Robbie over in the dinner queue and when Jossie said he was going to tell the teacher one of the boys grabbed hold of him and started wrestling with him to hold him back - Jossie got blamed and was told to move places in the dinner queue.

I also overheard one of the boys in the group talking about playing 'the bully game' and when I asked him what he meant he said &#034;we run round chasing people and if we catch them we punch them in the face&#034; - his mum overheard, laughed and told me to &#034;take it with a pinch of salt&#034;!!

Last week I was called into Robbie's class, to be told by the teacher that the phrase 'bully gang' was not acceptable and would I dissuade Robbie from using it. I told her the background and she said that she would look into it.

Today I was called into Jossie's class, to be told that he apparently attacked the group of boys who were playing football, telling them that he was playing 'the bully game', waving a stick at them and he hit one of them on the head with the stick.

I really don't know what to do - Jossie has been very clingy about going into school (they have been part-time since Sept and started full-time in Jan), he often says that he doesn't want to go to school, but now he is being accused of violence. It is making me so upset and I feel physically ill. ANY advice would be very welcome.

Thanks so much,

P1 was a nightmare he developed a limp on front of his neck which grew + grew but hospital wouldnt remove it until it was size of an apple! He got so much stick, Came ome crying everyday. The head teacher had to prise him off my legs in mornings! Got it removed during smmer hols + breezed through p2. ke was like a different boy. Much more confident + started to make friends. P3 the lump began to grow back at an alarming rate! Kids wouldnt play with him called him horrible names + started to hit him!Every day was a struggle to get him to school + every day he wold come home crying. I went to the school a hundred times to no avail! My sons behavior at home had become intolerable. He wiuld lash out at the family + say nasty things. I too im to doc for help.Hes been tested for umpteen behavior probs but came to nothing!i must ave been at school about 100+ times over the years. The bullying + behaviour has continued over the years. He was put back to repeat p4 as p5 was a real struggle for him. Had his lump removed again at beginning p5+ has had nothing but trouble since. 2 boys in particular call him names + hit him every day. Hes given up all is after school clubs + now sits in every day. His behaviour has improved dramatically tho until the last 3 wks. The bullying is worse than ever! Thursday he came home in a terrible state + refused to go to school Friday. I have been to school so many times + also seen the pupil . Nothing is making a bit of difference. All communication has broken down with the school. I cant even look at the head teacher right now.She jst makes pathetic excuses for these boys + makes my boy feel worse. She shouldnt even be ahead teacher!I am at the stage I would gladly keep him off school jst to make it stop!

He has an incident nearly every day. Things rangeing from being told 'go away i dont like you' to him being stabbed in the chest with a pencil! He has also had it where the children have been invited to parties, shown him thier invitations and he doesnt get invited. all of this is breaking my heart. He is so very upset every day when i pick him up. This is really affecting him and he isnt the same little boy as he was when he started at the school. He has one 'boy' friend but usually plays with two girls. He is extremely sensetive and i think the kids can sense this, he also has very low self esteem which is just about non existant now.

I have gone to the school about incidents before and the child involved has been spoken to and my son reassured, but its a diffrent child every day doing these things. I have told my son to stick up for himself but he is frightened and i have told him to tell teachers, but as they seem to brush his concerns off, he doesnt bother now. Im thinking of moving him to another school where his best friend is and maybe build up his confidenec a bit, but then im also worried this might happen there too. please help, I really am confused.

Gil37rfq,"Hi,

I am a first timer on here, but need some advice on what I should do about my son...he is 4 1/2 and a twin, very very tall for his age (6-7 clothes) and has suffered with glue ear, hence has grommets, but still struggles a little with communication due to the amount of time he was in his own world.

I was called into the school yesterday due to his violent behaviour, and told that it was being dealt with informally for now, but if it persits it would have to become official...his violent behaviour was pushing another childs hand onto the desk and asking him to not sit with him, this child is minute and screamed loud....I am not condoning my sons behaviour, but I was told that he was sent to the head teachers office due to the severity of the case.

On the same day there was another incident, where my son pulled a boys hair....I know you all now think he is a terrible child, until I tell you this was a year 6, 11 year old child, who teased my son as he was playing alone at lunch time, then pushed him over and punched him...when relayed to the school, they spoke to the child concerned...who denies this ever happened and states my son just went up to hiom and pulled his hair...therefore they can do no more about it...yet they have already punished my son....

I have a meeting with the head on friday...and just need some advice....what do I do....I am a Mum of four children at the same school...Hi,I am a first timer on here, but need some advice on what I should do about my son...he is 4 1/2 and a twin, very very tall for his age (6-7 clothes) and has suffered with glue ear, hence has grommets, but still struggles a little with communication due to the amount of time he was in his own world.I was called into the school yesterday due to his violent behaviour, and told that it was being dealt with informally for now, but if it persits it would have to become official...his violent behaviour was pushing another childs hand onto the desk and asking him to not sit with him, this child is minute and screamed loud....I am not condoning my sons behaviour, but I was told that he was sent to the head teachers office due to the severity of the case.When I spoke to my son, he asked this boy to leave as he was calling him names and teasing him, due to my sons inability to tell all quickley he has been punished before the full facts were attained, so telling this smaller child he only needs to scream and my son gets removed...On the same day there was another incident, where my son pulled a boys hair....I know you all now think he is a terrible child, until I tell you this was a year 6, 11 year old child, who teased my son as he was playing alone at lunch time, then pushed him over and punched him...when relayed to the school, they spoke to the child concerned...who denies this ever happened and states my son just went up to hiom and pulled his hair...therefore they can do no more about it...yet they have already punished my son....I have a meeting with the head on friday...and just need some advice....what do I do....I am a Mum of four children at the same school...",6,"1,391", 20-01-2010 at 2.05PM  
Sar79yhy,"Hi everyone, I'm new to Netmums and am here in support of a friend of mine who is extremely worried about her little boy how is nearly 6. I'll refer to him as J.

J is in Year 1 and in the main prefers to play with girls. He has two close friends outside of school, one being my son. He's known them since nursery and up until he started school J had no social problems.

Since he's started school, he's become friends with a little boy who we've all recently realised has been bullying J and not letting him play or mix with other children. He's quite nasty to J if he does go off and play with others, so for the last year or so, J has only been playing with this little boy.

J's parents were recently called into the school and informed of the problems. The school have been keeping the boys separated as much as they can, and my friend has been trying to find out which other boys J would like to play with. Unfortunately he's having real trouble making friends as he sees everyone already established in their friendships. 

My friend had an idea of trying to invite a few boys round for tea, but J won't give her any names, plus it's very near to Christmas and everyone's busy. She's been so upset about not knowing what to do, and I thought I'd ask for some advice on here because I really feel for her and don't know what to suggest.

Any help and advice would be gratefully received, thanks for taking the time to read this.

Sal22ivr,"Hi.
Im going to try to keep this as brief as possible although to give details it will be difficult. 
A family of Travellers were housed next to us over a year ago and both my husband, me and my two children have been victims of violence, both verbal and physical bullying, criminal damage and generally a life made miserable by this family for well over a year now.
We have had death threats made by the father to all of us including my 2 year old daughter. My son is constantly bullied by the four children and is verbally bullied by the mother.
Just yesterday one of the children (who never seem to be at school)threw a stone which hit my daughter on the side of the head. Two weeks ago one of the boys (who is 12)wrapped a metal chain around his fist and punched my 9 year old in the side of the head, along with two other of his friends. The mother and father just stood there, egging their son on!!! We called the police out to this incident and even though 3 boys were attacked and there were lots of witnesses they did nothing. 
We are tenants of Saffron Housing Association in Norfolk and they, along with South Norfolk Council have done nothing to help us at all. Saffron Housing Association just keep saying &#034;Oh sorry but thats not our department -phone the police/phone enviromental health&#034; But surely it is their responsibility because they are their tennants!!! They just told us to go inside whenever anything happens. I cannot even go out in the back garden without having to listen to the children chanting disgusting abuse at me and my children. We have to put up with this every day. My son lost his father to suicide when he was three and a half and has emotional problems. He has become so depressed because of all the bullying and violence here. As if things for him aren't difficult enough.
Why are these evil people getting away with absolutely EVERYTHING, yet if it was you or I doing it we would have hell to pay from the authorities.
Im at my wits end and am even thinking about going to the papers as I just cannot get any help anywhere.
Please please please can anyone help me as I dont know how much more we can take. Its completely destroying our lives.

Luc34anr,"I would really appreciate some advice ladies. 

My daughter is almost 5 and has been in Reception for 6 weeks, its a small class of 15 children, most of which she has been at nursery with since she was 2.5. She is a very mature and confident little girl, but very caring and kind. 

She made friends in nursery with &#034;K&#034; and &#034;S&#034;, they have always played nicely together but towards the end of their nursery days my daughter would come home and say &#034;K wont let me play with S and says I am not her friend anymore&#034; I naturally told her to just ignore K and play with whoever she liked and that its good for children to have lots of friends, not just one.

K's mum is very competitive. Overly competive in fact and had a strop at me because my daughter goes to school full time when her daughter (due to age) will only go half day until January - how this is my fault I dont know! anyway i only pick up my daughter in the afternoons as I work and my mum drops her off for me. Last week was &#034;childrens book week&#034; and my daughter asked to go as Little MIss Sunshine from the Mr Men. K's mother made a commoent to my daughter and said &#034;Oh Sophia havent you taken the initiative and dressed differently to everyone else, all the other girls are Princesses - good thinking Sophia I guess you will win the prize today&#034; My mum (is very quiet) just looked at K's mum confused and walked away. My daughter was chosen for a part in the Harvest Festival and had to say some lines, K's mum and S's mum were sitting in front of me (didnt realise i could see) and when my daughter came out on stage, rolled their eyes and said something along the lines of &#034;she gets chosen for everything&#034; I think its just that she is confident and a clear speaker so they chose her - there is no favouritisim at all.

Yesterday evening i got a call on my mobile and it was K's mum. She wanted to make me aware that she has made a complaint about my daughter &#034;bullying&#034; her little girl in class :shock: so I asked her what has been happening and she said that my daughter laughed at her daughters knickers when they got changed for P.E and &#034;forced&#034; the rest of the class to laugh at her. Now I know that I am her mum and so i am going to be protective of her but it just didnt sound like something my daughter would do, and I told the mum that. She replied with &#034;well me, S's mum and another mum have been talking about this in the playground and we've grilled our kids and they agree&#034; :( then she said the teaching assistant had to tell off my daughter yesterday for being &#034;mean&#034; to K. 

I spoke to my daughter and she said she had never laughed at K's knickers and &#034;why would I do that mummy&#034; she also said that K still tells her not to play with S but she does not mind and finds someone else to play with. I asked my daguhter if Marion (TA) told her off yesterday and her words were &#034;No Marion never told me off, ask her tomorrow mummy, i am not a liar and I am telling the truth&#034; my daughter then got very upset and so did I. 

I am new to all of this playground gossip with mums and i just keep myself to myself and dont get involved but I wanted to speak to the teacher. She affirmed that my daughter has NEVER been mean to any other child and is (in her words) &#034;A lovely, kind, confident child&#034; I spoke to the head too because its such a small school they like the head to be involved in most things, and said i feel my 4 year old is being bullied by 3 grown women and that if K's mum had spoken to the teacher why had the teacher not spoken to me? the head said (very diplomatically) that it would usually be because the teacher had no concerns with my daughters behaviour. She also said that the children change for P.E in front of the teacher and that some giggling goes on because they are all a bit shy of getting underessed for the first few weeks, under no circumstances woudl another child be allowed to &#034;round up&#034; the class to laugh at someones underwear. 

I just dont know what to do. i feel like taking my daughter out of the school now because i feel these mums are &#034;bullying&#034; her and talking about her. I am also 8 months pregnant and the two mums were &#034;waiting&#034; for me outside the gates this morning :shakeshead: i was too scared to leave the school until I had someone to walk out with. I also would appreciate any advice on what do I say to my child? I dont want to tell her she cant play with K and S as they are friends and i just think the mums are using my daughter as a reason to moan at the school.

Reb73bfd,"Hello everyone. 

First I have to admit, I am not a mother. I am training to be a teacher.

I was bullied horrifically in school. Started in Primary school. I was different. I liked to volunteer and help the teacher, and I didn't really get on with my own age. But things got really bad when I got to sceondary school. I stopped telling my mum about the bullying because she would respond with 'what have you done to make them want to bully you.' Please, never say that to your kids, it does nothing other that to damage their self esteem even more.

Anyway, this girl, Z, decided she didn't like me. It started as namecalling, and progressed from there. I told my teacher a couple of times, but it always sounds so lame when you tell, and the teachers didn't really listen. 

Z and her little possy would flick bits of rubber or paper at me in class, kick the back of my chair and pass me threatening notes, and this was just in the classroom. Outside class she would spit half chewed food at me, shove me down the stairs, empty my bag, rip up my work and steal things from me. And that was just the start.

Not all teachers were completely usless. Some were really good. My drama teacher caught Z spitting a half chewed sandwich at me, and he didn't turn a blind eye, but instead delt with it. But Z wasn't very happy with having to scrape chewing gum off the bottom of the tables in about 5 classrooms, so she got her revenge. That was my first (but not last) bog wash. 

One day, during PE, she shoved me, pushed me, throw the balls at my head, kicked me and called me names, all in front of the teacher. she ignored it, because Z was her favourite pupil. In the end I lost it, and swung round and shoved. I shouldn't have retaliated, I know that. But the teacher dragged me to the PE office, gave me a detention and made me stand outside the PE office for the rest of lesson and all break. When I got back to the changing room to get changed, someone had put all my school clothes under the showers, so it was all soaking wet. The PE teacher just laughed. That was when I decided I had had enough, and I went and saw the headmistress. The headmistress was really good, and detested bullying. I think she was a bit annoyed with the PE teacher too, because the PE teacher wasn't best pleased with the fact I went to the head. 

But, I still didn't report it as often as I should have done. Z had me scared, and she knew it. She hit me with a wooden ruler repeatedly, used her lighter to burn my arm and did anything she could to scare me, on top of all the name calling and general intimidation. She really knocked my self esteem. The Headmistress knew, I think. She used to ask me how I was and if everything was okay. I said everything was fine. 

Then it reached a climax. She wanted to pick on me, but I walked away, so she chased me. She pushed me into a classroom (with her buddies) and held my arm on a radiator that was on. I told the school nurse I just brushed past the radiator, Needless to say she didn't believe me, and she went to get the headmistress. When the headmistress came in, she was fuming. She was caring towards me, but I tell you, I would not have wanted to be Z then. She told me, firmly, that if Z EVER does anything like this again, I am to see her immediately. Z got a 2 week suspension, and then was made to make an apology in front of the school. She was also told that she'd me expelled if it continued.

She stopped, for a while. In year 11 she tried again, but was kicked out straight away, and only allowed in for her exams.

I want to be a teacher like her, who dealt with bullying seriously. I am in my late 20s now, and just training to be a teacher, with the hope to progress up the ranks. It has taken years to get my self esteem back, and I still have confidence issues. But I have some very close friends and I am in a very stable relationship. Z, however, has about 4 kids, all different fathers. 

I am also working on an anti bullying film.

Basically, what I am saying is that there is light at the end of the tunnel. I got through it, and as a result I am determined to be like my headmistress, and deal with the issues head on. Bullying is awful, and those who have to see their kids getting bullied, make sure to find a teacher with power who takes it seriously, and ask them to deal with it. There is hope.Hello everyone.

Deleted profile,"My 7 year old daughter is a happy, chatty, outgoing little girl who is involved with lots of extra curricular activities.

She attends dance and drama, Brownies, karate and cheer leading mainly to allow her opportunity to socialise. She makes friends very easily and enjoys friendship with the children from these groups.

However, in our area - which is very small and rural - the children (and their parents) are very cliqey and the kids will allow my dd to play with them -sometimes. This usually ends with my dd in tears because ot seems the other kids will find anything at all to pick on her. They tell her she is rubbish at dancing and will put her down whenever they can.

I am fed up of complaining to school about the attitude of the other kids and to be fair the school always seem to sort it for a short time before it starts up again.

I would prefer dd to not play with these kids but she is desperate for a friend within our local area. She started back to school three days ago and has burst into tears as soon as we get into the car when I pick her up (Each day). It turns out that nobody will play with her, sit with her or allow her to share their coloured pencils - yet she allows them to share her gel pens etc.

Anyway she is now saying that everyone hates her, she is stupid and different and she is beginning to overeat.

Michelle A(199),"Hi all

Since starting reception last September my dd has had problems with another girl in her class. She seems to have a natural authority and is very controlling. Initially, she was persuading the other kids not to play with my dd and we had tears at home time. My dd's best friend was also being picked on by her, and it's through her that I actually found out what was being said. This bully was constantly asking my dd if she believed in god/jesus - 'if you don't believe in god you'll go to a room where there's fire and you'll burn'. I don't think my dd mentioned this because she doesn't really understand what she's talking about - we're not religious and so have never taught her about god/jesus. My dd apparently kept telling her that yes, she believed in god so she wouldn't get in trouble with this bully. She also told my dd 'I can do what I want, your mum really loves me but she doesn't care about you'. She told another little girl that she wanted to set fire to her house and watch her bang on the windows trying to get out. This is really alarming - they're 5 years old!!

Needless to say, I spoke with their teacher who was also alarmed. But nothing seems to have changed - because about once a fortnight they're all best friends the teacher just takes it as petty squabbling. Thing is, I think they only make friends occasionally because bully 'allows' her to play, thus making my dd feel honoured for the day. Next day it's back to usual and nobody's allowed to play with dd cos she doesn't respect god.

Anyway they're back to school this week and this girl is unfortunately in the same class again. I spoke with the new teacher about it on the first day back, as my dd has been worried all summer. I asked teacher if she would keep them completely separated, and she agreed she try her best. It's been fine up til now, but it looks like it's started again today. I'm so worried - my little one is completely controlled by this girl, she does whatever she says. Anyway I'm going to keep a close eye on the situation I think and bug the life out of the teachersHi allSince starting reception last September my dd has had problems with another girl in her class.

Jan52xtf,"Hi Caroline,
I am at my wits end. My 6 year old is really struggling at school. He hasn't been there long and has started to come home saying that the children at the school wouldn't play with him and asked if I could speak to his teacher and get him some friends. His teacher was great, and during carpet time found him some friends who he had for a few weeks. Then it all started. To cut a long story short, my boy was being sent to the headteacher on a regular basis for 'harming other children'.....week after week he was coming home with letters from school to say he had been to the headteacher for 'harming other children'. Every night when I picked him up there was an incident to report., he'd pushed a child, nipped a child, stamped on a child's foot etc....

I was distraught. I spoke to the teacher every single night to try and track what was going on, she was puzzled why he was being so agressive to other children one week, and then saying it wasn't a problem the week after. He is an absolute angel for about 3 weeks and then out of the blue it all kicks off again and he's back to the headteacher again and again.....every night a report about him. The school were painting him to be an absolute psychopath just randomly attacking others without cause !!!!

All through this the only defence my boy had was that they were tormenting him, pulling faces, nipping first, pushing him and that he was only defending himself. I went into the headteacher and went right through it all.....they were adamant that the children my boy was involved with were absolute angels and would never,ever do anything wrong. My boy is at fault with no questions asked.

I was told that because he has moved schools and house recently, and his dad doesn't live under the same roof (my son sees him every day and we are all very happy !!!) then he is traumatised and he needs to see a doctor !!!!!!!!

I have taken him to the doctor who laughed at me and said it was a cop out by the school and that in 99.9% of these cases, there is an underlying problem where the child being blamed is being bullied somewhere along the line. My boy told the doctor that a set few children in his class are hitting and pushing him and making him 'angry' so he is just defending himself.

Yesterday when I told his teacher he'd been to the doctors for 'help' she told me that she wasn't 'convinced'..........with a look on her face as if to say it's not all his fault......... 

Picked him up today and he was the first out of the door, grabbed me and got away as soon as he could (before the teacher got me!!)

Tonight i have decided upon a new approach.....I have told my son that if he tells me exactly what's happened at school when he's been in trouble, it will be a 'secret' between only the two of us and that if I know the full true story, I will be able to better help him....I won't shout at him but will be really pleased that he's been honest. He then told me there had been an incident over a football today and he and another boy had been in trouble for kicking each other whilst they were disputing who was to take a penalty !!

My plan is to keep a tally of what's happening to hopefully be able to piece it all together.

HELP !!!!!! It is continuous cycle that is repeating itself ..... Is he a bully or being bullied?

Deleted profile,"Hi,

My ds started reception is September and within the first two weeks had a terrible time coming home with a black eye, cut on his face etc and I did talk to the teacher. His teacher was quite dismissive saying that it was 6 of one and half a dozen of the other but when I pointed out that the other boys involved had come out of school without a mark on them yet my DS had visible injuries so it was clearly not six of one and half a dozen of the other she admiitted that one particular boy was a bit problematic and had latched onto my DS. She had noticed that even when my DS tried to get away from him and as working/playing quite happily the other boy would always try to go over and within minutes they would be rowing. 

This has been going on since September although my DS has not come home with any more injuries he protests and cries every morning that he does not want to go to school and when I ask why he claims the other children hurt him. When I question him further he names this particular boy. This boys mother says her son loves school.

The other day I witnessed this boy for no reason without provocation push my ds really hard so he flew onto the floor and DS got up and hit him before I could reach them, the mother was nowhere in sight chatting round the corner. I got both boys and asked them to apologise to each other and his mother comes over freaking out saying she has had enough of this!!!!! I have asked my DS to stay away from this particular boy but am not sure if this weill be enough. Not really sure what to do but I do know I have an unhappy little boy who hates school which he shouldn't because he is very popular and gets invited to all the parties even from children in the other class which none of the rest do. He was always so excited to go to nursery and had loads of friends and I was sure he would love school to. This other little boy was only allowed limited nursery session because they could not control him!!

The worst thing is our daughters go the same nursery and my DD is always complaining about her DD hitting her and pulling her. The mother is not approachable, smacks her kids in public, promotes her kids hitting if someone hits them but finds it unacceptable the other way round and she knows everyone and I don't know anyone round here. I have taken to begging other people to do the school run and if I do it literally run with the kids as fast as we can. It is a wonderful school and nursery but I feel like moving just because of this one family.Hi,My ds started reception is September and within the first two weeks had a terrible time coming home with a black eye, cut on his face etc and I did talk to the teacher.  His teacher was quite dismissive saying that it was 6 of one and half a dozen of the other but when I pointed out that the other boys involved had come out of school without a mark on them yet my DS had visible injuries so it was clearly not six of one and half a dozen of the other she admiitted that one particular boy was a bit problematic and had latched onto my DS.  She had noticed that even when my DS tried to get away from him and as working/playing quite happily the other boy would always try to go over and within minutes they would be rowing.  This has been going on since September although my DS has not come home with any more injuries he protests and cries every morning that he does not want to go to school and when I ask why he claims the other children hurt him.  When I question him further he names this particular boy.  This boys mother says her son loves school.The other day I witnessed this boy for no reason without provocation push my ds really hard so he flew onto the floor and DS got up and hit him before I could reach them, the mother was nowhere in sight chatting round the corner.  I got both boys and asked them to apologise to each other and his mother comes over freaking out saying she has had enough of this!!!!!  I have asked my DS to stay away from this particular boy but am not sure if this weill be enough.  Not really sure what to do but I do know I have an unhappy little boy who hates school which he shouldn't because he is very popular and gets invited to all the parties even from children in the other class which none of the rest do.   He was always so excited to go to nursery and had loads of friends and I was sure he would love school to.  This other little boy was only allowed limited nursery session because they could not control him!!The worst thing is our daughters go the same nursery and my DD is always complaining about her DD hitting her and pulling her.  The mother is not approachable, smacks her kids in public, promotes her kids hitting if someone hits them but finds it unacceptable the other way round and she knows everyone and I don't know anyone round here.  I have taken to begging other people to do the school run and if I do it literally run with the kids as fast as we can.  It is a wonderful school and nursery but I feel like moving just because of this one family.",18,"3,222", 04-02-2009 at 10.11PM  
rosie l,"Bit of a long story...........my son was best friends with my best friends son for about 6 yrs.As us mums were friends,they were together constantly.

In year 6 the two boys fell out.My sons friend seem to turn against mine.It all started over girls and then my son getting quite friendly with another lad.

Cutting a long story short,we as parents and friends fell out over it.............the situation got worse at school,the two boys were physically fighting etc...I fell out with my friend because she shouted at my son so I sent her a nasty text........the two dads fell out over it,the boys' teacher was saying one thing to me and another to my friend............we'd have other children round our house siding with our son,then they'd go to my friends and side with her son..........it got all really out of hand.It made me/is making me really ill............

My son was so unhappy The school got involved but nothing much was resolved.

The school broke up for the long break and the two boys went their seperate ways.Despite what had happened,my son missed his friend,and I encouraged my son to phone him,to be friends.I thought what a sad situation,if they're both sitting at home missing each other.

They seemed to have made up and although were not great friends,they had the odd hour together and seemed civil to each other if they saew each other the park etc...

I thought if they were going to be friends,I'd try and mend a few bridges with my friend.She wasn't having any of it,but I thought ho hum,I'd tried.I'd encouraged my son to offer an olive branch,and I tried to take my own advice.I did recieve a birthday card and text of her last week,however.

Forward to now and the two boys are in high school together,and this week the problems have seemed to start again.My son has made new friends and has a new circle of boys to be with.................and my friends son seem jealous of this.Hes always trying to muscle his way in or talk over my son or push him out.Although this bothers me (along with the constant smirking and smiling at my son when they catch each others eye) the boy is now pushing my son through the corridors between lessons,swinging his bags around to &#034;accidentally&#034; catch my son and generally just trying to push or upset him.

My hubby was at a point where he was becoming friends again with this boys dad (they went down the pub sun night together) so he phoned him..................not even accusingly,just to say theres been some trouble again today and what was his sons version.

Well the outcome has been that apparently hes told his dad,my son stares at him constantly,has no friends,hes got at least 10 new friends and my son follows his about constantly.................and we believe anything our son tells us:shock: Now I know my own son,and I know we always believe our own children,but I know this not to be true.I've even met my sons new friends!

As a result my son has now phoned this boy and asked why he tells his dad this and that and the boy puts the phone down on him! Now if thats not the actions of a liar,I'm not sue what is 

The school is aware of todays situation and they say they will sort it.But will they? What if my son becomes this boys victim for the next 4 years? The primary school always said they would sort it,but they didn't.................and how can they when its one word against another? After all,they've only been at school,3 weeks...............its not as if anyone knows them well enough?

I really feel as though I can't go through all this again.I've already lost my best friend over it........although I've come to terms with that and my son is more important...............but I've feel as though my family has been put through hell because of this boy.My hubby seems to think the school won't have it,but this boy just seems so manliputative?Bit of a long story...........my son was best friends with my best friends son for about 6 yrs.As us mums were friends,they were together constantly.In year 6 the two boys fell out.My sons friend seem to turn against mine.It all started over girls and then my son getting quite friendly with another lad.Cutting a long story short,we as parents and friends fell out over it.............the situation got worse at school,the two boys were physically fighting etc...I fell out with my friend because she shouted at my son so I sent her a nasty text........the two dads fell out over it,the boys' teacher was saying one thing to me and another to my friend............we'd have other children round our house siding with our son,then they'd go to my friends and side with her son..........it got all really out of hand.It made me/is making me really ill............My son was so unhappy  The school got involved but nothing much was resolved.The school broke up for the long break and the two boys went their seperate ways.Despite what had happened,my son missed his friend,and I encouraged my son to phone him,to be friends.I thought what a sad situation,if they're both sitting at home missing each other.They seemed to have made up and although were not great friends,they had the odd hour together and seemed civil to each other if they saew each other the park etc...I thought if they were going to be friends,I'd try and mend a few bridges with my friend.She wasn't having any of it,but I thought ho hum,I'd tried.I'd encouraged my son to offer an olive branch,and I tried to take my own advice.I did recieve a birthday card and text of her last week,however.Forward to now and the two boys are in high school together,and this week the problems have seemed to start again.My son has made new friends and has a new circle of boys to be with.................and my friends son seem jealous of this.Hes always trying to muscle his way in or talk over my son or push him out.Although this bothers me (along with the constant smirking and smiling at my son when they catch each others eye) the boy is now pushing my son through the corridors between lessons,swinging his bags around to ""accidentally"" catch my son and generally just trying to push or upset him.My hubby was at a point where he was becoming friends again with this boys dad (they went down the pub sun night together) so he phoned him..................not even accusingly,just to say theres been some trouble again today and what was his sons version.Well the outcome has been that apparently hes told his dad,my son stares at him constantly,has no friends,hes got at least 10 new friends and my son follows his about constantly.................and we believe anything our son tells us:shock: Now I know my own son,and I know we always believe our own children,but I know this not to be true.I've even met my sons new friends!As a result my son has now phoned this boy and asked why he tells his dad this and that and the boy puts the phone down on him!

What if my son becomes this boys victim for the next 4 years? The primary school always said they would sort it,but they didn't.................and how can they when its one word against another? After all,they've only been at school,3 weeks...............its not as if anyone knows them well enough?I really feel as though I can't go through all this again.I've already lost my best friend over it........although I've come to terms with that and my son is more important...............but I've feel as though my family has been put through hell because of this boy.My hubby seems to think the school won't have it,but this boy just seems so manliputative?",4,"1,416", 26-09-2007 at 6.12PM  
M B18rlz,"Never thought I would write on a board like this but for 2 yrs my son (now 7) has been bullied and physically hurt by a group of boys who are now ages 10-13. i have been letting it pass as i thought it would sort itself out and boys will be boys.

however last night i had some mouthy woman at my door complaining about MY son saying he has trouble. my son is not an angel but he is quiet and thoughtful and socialises with the girls on our estate and not the boys.

without going into too much detail this woman is the mother of the main bully. she also works for the school which they both attend. she told me that apparently the assistant head teacher told her that 2 complaints had been made about ME calling children names in the playground. this woman is a cleaner at the school.

Firstly i have to say that i am 37 and this must be some sort of joke - i dont call anyone names let alone primary school kids. secondly what approach do i take re this? this cleaner says she has &#034;heard lots&#034; about me from this assistant head teacher yet i am here on my own with my 3 kids and i dont go out with anyone in my town (or anywhere actually) i dont drink or smoke and i dont hang about gossiping like they obviously do. Is there not some form of privacy rules re. teachers gossiping to cleaners?? my biggest concern is that MOST of the teachers/cleaners/assistants that work at the school ALL have kids who attend same school therefore its gossip this gossip that. Also we are moving (thank GOD) soon and i know that schools must give reports about the kids to the next school and i wondered if i have the right to SEE this report?
can anyone help me or make me see that im not actually going bonkers because as i read this back it sounds madness.

ps. this boy had been expelled from his last school and amongst MANY other things has broken my sons bike AND scooter, stolen his loose change, thrown him in a hedge, made sexual comments about my 9 yr old daughter and called me a f... b..ch in the street.

NICE. thanks if someone can point me in the right direction?Never thought I would write on a board like this but for 2 yrs my son (now 7) has been bullied and physically hurt by a group of boys who are now ages 10-13. i have been letting it pass as i thought it would sort itself out and boys will be boys.however last night i had some mouthy woman at my door complaining about MY son saying he has trouble. my son is not an angel but he is quiet and thoughtful and socialises with the girls on our estate and not the boys.without going into too much detail this woman is the mother of the main bully. she also works for the school which they both attend. she told me that apparently the assistant head teacher told her that 2 complaints had been made about ME calling children names in the playground. this woman is a cleaner at the school.Firstly i have to say that i am 37 and this must be some sort of joke - i dont call anyone names let alone primary school kids. secondly what approach do i take re this? this cleaner says she has ""heard lots"" about me from this assistant head teacher yet i am here on my own with my 3 kids and i dont go out with anyone in my town (or anywhere actually) i dont drink or smoke and i dont hang about gossiping like they obviously do.

don39aay,"Hi, I have 9 year old daughter who unfortunately suffers with psoriasis, she has been refered to the hospital with it. It effects her nails on hands and feet and also she has it in her scalp which has caused bold patches that we cannot hide. Before the holidays i noticed that she became more aggressive so took her to the peadiatricain to see what was wrong and it turned out that she was trying to deal with nasty comments from the children about her psoriasis. Apparently because she wasnt reacting to the comments at school, she was bottling up her anger and letting it all out at home where she knew she was safe. While i know kids can be cruel and a lot of it is that they are unsure of her condition, is it really classed as bullying as its not the same child on a regular basis its random children noticing she is different and commenting on it. 
I am going to see the head teacher to see if anything can be done about it as soon as school starts, but as i know the comments will not stop totally so was wondering of any groups or techniques we could use to help her deal with the comments and the hurt they are causing my beautiful girl??Hi, I have 9 year old daughter who unfortunately suffers with psoriasis, she has been refered to the hospital with it.

Deleted profile,":hiya:

My son is 5 and is moving up to Yr 1 in September. Most of last year he was bullied by another boy in his class which all came to a head in the last couple of weeks of last term. He was being bullied emotionally and physically.

To cut a long story short, the head teacher has got the measure of what has been going on, and it has been recognised that my son is being bullied, who the bully is and the reasons behind it.

I've been assured by the head teacher that they're going to monitor the situation closely and not let it continue next term. However, the boys are going to remain in the same class and I can't help but feel anxious about about whether the bullying will resume, and the effect it is going to have on my son. On a selfish note, I'm not looking forward to having to see the other boys mum every day who, needless to say, is not too happy that her son has been doing this, and seems to be directing her anger about this at me.

I'm absolutlely dreading the new school year and am desperately trying not to pass on this negativity to my son who is himself, understandably, feeling anxious about going back to school.

Is anyone else feeling like this?

Dawn T(4),"I'll try and cut a longish story short....but i have written a post on this before about a year or so ago....anyway....the saga continues....sad as it is.

Basically we have bullies in our close....a girl of 10/11 and her brother of 5/6...these 2 kids hold the monopoly on the rest of the close kids due to the oldest girls age. The girl...whom i'll refer to as &#034;madam&#034; is the main instigator telling other children not to play with my son who is 6. It all started about 2 years ago when the 2 kids saw cory's toys and garden. We live on a new estate and as most of you may know if you've moved into a new house that sometimes the back garden isn't very usable due to it not being flat...anyway we wanted a child friendly usable garden and paid for it to be done. we have a swing/glider set and a slide. We also have a steel pool and the other usual kids stuff like the ride in cars/bikes/scooters etc. The other 2 kids garden has been done for adults....no grass ... just plants and gravel. Can i also just add their parents like material things...but not necessarily for the kids...they have made it known how big there house is and how big the TV they have is. This isn't our fault but the oldest child &#034;madam&#034; has since become incredibly jealous and with this came the nasty comments and her getting all the stret kids not to play with our son. Last year our son met a lovely girl who actually neighbours these other children and she to has become embroiled in this situation...maybe for the opposite in that her house is smaller than there's...who knows but they also dislike and are nasty to her. We have told them to ignore and not antagonise them as i know my son does and he's been called on it. i'm not saying my son can't give as good as he gets but to be up against a child almost twice his age teamed with the other street kids....he and his friend doesn't stand a chance. Up until now things have been lets say not bad....okay then...but today cory and his friend came in to me and said that the children are calling them freaks and being generally cruel and mean....so i decided to go and have a chat to the parents....my hubby has attempted this before back when in all started...unfortunatly that didn't go down to well....and neither did it today. (Can i just add that this is the first time that i have spoke to their parents...albut for a short time when we had a bbq and a pool party last May...the conversation well it wasn't really lol...just the usual hello and how are u...me thinks they too were jealous of our garden) I originally told my son and his friend to go and tell the other kid's parents but the other kids were stopping them from getting to the door.....this is where i came in....my intention was to let each child tell there own story and then to hopefully come up with an answer of how to work it out (as i wasn't actually there i was only there for support and to make sure my child got to the door to be able to speak)....unfortunatly i had no chance as soon as i spoke up about the issue the husband of the pair immediatly went into what my son does....i tried to stop him by saying...can u let me finish and that i wasn't here for my son...although i did say that i know my son is no angel and he has been repremanded for his behaviour but he then went onto closing the door in my and my son and his friend's face (the bully's and their gang were also watching this). I'm so disgusted and mad....and SHOCKED. Seeing that they were not adult in conversating and whilst the door was being closed in our faces...i added for them to keep their kids away from mine...as it was obvious they were not going to sort it out or give a dam what their children were doing or saying. This is obviously where the children get it from....imagine having parents like that who can't even have an adult chat to sort out issues. I'd expect as my husband told them a year or so ago, that if there was any problems concerning our son to come over and tell us. how can we parents do anything if we are unaware of issues. I would be open to dealing with situations concerning my son...i know its not pleasant to hear about the bad things your child says and does but it is part of growing up and us parents need to guide them in the right direction if we can. Slamming the door and not talking about it is very childish and goodness knows what that's saying to a child. The little girl...our son's friend immediatly said thats not nice shutting the door on us...i said yes it is rude but to not worry and go and play and ignore them all. This has just literally just happened....and here i am wondering whether i did the right thing or not. I want to show these people and these children that i won't tolerate behaviour of that kind and that i'm there for my son. Most of the time i like to let our son try and figure it out himself but now with them bullying not only him but his friend who's only 4 almost 5...its getting ridiculous. My son told me that he dislikes living in this street...more so now as his little friend has their house up for sale so will be moving....there'll be no-one again for my son. I know he has weekend activities during school time....but what about the holidays??? I'm so frustrated with this as my hubby is away working, so he's not here to help or support me. I'm in between shocked, anger and i feel like crying. I guess i'm after some support here and maybe some ideas of how to continue to handle this situation. I know its been almost 2 years of this behaviour so know full well its not going to improve unless the bullies move out or they grow up - or worse we move. The parents of my son's friend have also said about the behaviour of the 2 kids....the boy...bluntly saying to my son's friends father that they have a very small kitchen and that his house's kitchen is huge.

 Sorry i've not paragraphed any of this but i'm so emotional right now i can't think straight. i only hope you make sense of what i've wrote lol. Today had been a good day too until all this. Me and my son went bowling this morning and had lunch there. Then he and his friend went out to the shops and then to mcdonalds....and then to this awfulness. But seriously do you think i did the right thing....i feel bad that both my and my son's friend had to see this but i didn't expect to get what i did. As said due to my not being around and actually hearing what was said i can only go by what my son and his friend had said although i did see madam and her bandits running back and for shouting something to my son and his friend.

He still involves others mainly by chasing my son around the field.

I went looking the headteacher was no where to be seen i wated a while then there he was i asked to speak with him when i enetered the office the headteacher said he has just spoken to my son teacher.

 i dont believe a teacher should tell a 5yrs old child he is a bully and not mention to the parents what they actually said to the child,telling the child he is a bully dosnt help or teaches a child right from wrong.If my child was unable to communicate with me i would never know that my child is being labeled as a bully. I honestly believe my child should not have hit the other child weather he thought the other child had touched him or not.I am so upset and am not sure if am being silly about the situation or not i just believe if the teacher can complain to me about my child misbehaving i also believe if she thought it was appropriate for her her called my child and bully she would have mention to me what she had said to my child .hiya hope everyone is having a better day than i am.

I dont find this fair what is my boy meant to do if no one is listening to him. He cnt be expected to take it every day and every playtime. Sorry needed to rant I dont like my ds doing this by I know why he did and it has been provoked and a backlash has been a long time coming",12,"2,349", 16-06-2009 at 10.08PM  
Sue86fti,"Hi

I am really sorry to read all of these threads, so wanted to say what parents at ds's school did. Many whose kids had been there for a few years felt bullying was out of control. Ofsted visited two weeks ago and loads of parents wrote to them saying how bad it was. I have to say, we've been unaware of the extent of it and DS, who is five, generally likes his school BUT My ds was starting to think is it is normal to be bullied, he's seen so much violence. I have been teaching him to NOT be a bystander - to help bullied kids, as well as stand up for himself. We've had one incident where DS was covered in grip marks on his back - nasty bruises and no one told us about these, even though the other child had been caught in the act - we found out later when we went to see DS's teacher. She suggested DS was shy and needed to come forward more...

It is irrelevant whether the bullied kid is shy (Head throws this at parents, too, I've heard: your kid must be shy and is a 'natural' victim), outgoing, scared, not scared; the schools have to keep an eye on this and act.

Due to all the letters given to Ofsted, ds's school has just gone into special measures for the second time in four years due to deep concerns about bullying and safety. Ofsted found the school hadn't complied with its own policies and that many 'accidents' were not recorded.

Well, we don;t know what happens now and I have been trying to get another school (different thread though!), but the Ofsted inspection did spot the issues.
best of luck everyone - and any advice on how to beat the bullies most welcome, cos we may be stuck there for years.HiI am really sorry to read all of these threads, so wanted to say what parents at ds's school did.

Nic98zus,"Just wondering if anyone could give me some advice, we are having a terrible time with my son's school at the moment.
Basically there is a core of about 4 boys in his class who are nightmare,swearing, fighting, walking out of class etc etc. My son was being hit by pencils/rubbers which were being thrown at him. The headmaster moved my son to another class, as we were so angry that they were not doing anything, I insisted he was moved so he could enjoy school again.
Anyway it's ok for a while and then it flares up again, my son was told that I would be shot at work (I'm a PC) and would come home in a bodybag and I would be dead. The two boys admitted what they said, but just got a letter home as they had been honest about what they have said!!.
There has been recent incidents where again, he has objects thrown at him. The two boys were supposed to go to another class for the whole day, but it ended up being just for the morning.
Today I hear my son has been in a fight, one of the boys has been throwing pencils/rubbers at him and then started pusing him. The other boys were telling him he was fat and that his family are fat (we're not, which isn't the point, but it upset him), my son snapped and when the other boy was pushing and kicking him, he gave as good as it got basically!!. This was in front of a supply teacher who watched, another teacher came in and had to break them up!.
I have emailed my concerns to the headmaster before, and had meetings with him. His reply is that he will monitor it. Don't get me wrong my son is not an angel!, he is always chatting in class, but he is not a fighter at all. The other boys are all on charts and have to see the headmaster each day, my son has never been on one of these charts.
I have written a letter to the chair of governors, which I will hand in on Monday. I have asked that my son goes into another class in September for Year 5. Does anyone have any advice, unfortunately we are at the stage where we have had to say, if someone is attcking him then he needs to stand up for himself.
We have just bought a house, and if I can find a flexible childminder to work around my shifts, we are considering moving schools. The schools in the area are so much better, whereas my son's school has gone downhill!

Sorry to waffle on, any advice greatfully recieved!!

Cee42mbo,"I'm despairing here as I just don't know what to do next and really need some help. DS started this school 11/2 yr ago and was ok for the first six months. Then I started hearing stories when he moved into year one. He came back with a bit more than a scratch on his neck where a boy in his class had pulled him under a table and pushed a plastic knife into his neck (I have a photo). Obviously I was up at the school in the headmistresses office straightaway who told me she would take action. There on after I hear about this same troublemaker boy every day and the things he says and does. My Ds starting acting and sounding like this child, he seems to have a big influence on him and consequently mine has been in trouble, and once himself in the headmistresses office for teasing another child, using a name he was mimicking off the troublemaker.

My DS's behaviour has been difficult in the last six months, he's never satisfied, makes loud random noises and just behaves quite eratically. He's fine, however during holidays or long weekends when he's away from that bloody school!

Me and OH have been several times to both teacher and headmistresses to seprate my Dh and this other child. I get the feeling they think we are making a mountain out of a molehill, and feel fobbed off with their &#034;help&#034;. I dont know what they have done to help other than nod a few times.

We had managed to educate DS to move away form the other boy and helped him to recognise that he was encouraging him to get into trouble, things were improving. Now another boy has started kicking and fighting with DS, they seemed to be friends at first, but this one seems really rough and now I am hearing daily stories of this kick and that punch. The other day he had a severe bruise on his leg where this boy had kicked him &#034;as hard as he can mummy&#034;.

Now he came home from school today visibly upset, angry and saying he never wantes to go to school. The teacher said it had been sorted out and didnt know why he brought it up &#034;again&#034;. I find it quite bizarre!! I later found out this other boy ahd thrown mine to the floor and punched his arm &#034;so hard&#034;, and had to go the headmistress. I've had it! What else can I do - I am listening to his stories ever day now for six months and its not getting better, its obviously affecting him.

Frustratingly another school is closer to us, but we cant get in. we are 1st on the waiting list, and I am desperate for him to go there -- or I will have to relocate, because I cant watch my child suffering on and off like this. The school is obviously not right for him, and they seem to care less.I'm despairing here as I just don't know what to do next and really need some help.

Emm35xgj,"Hi. My 4 yo has recently been accused of bullying. The teacher called me in and said that lots of parents have approached her to say that my lil one is causing problems.
He is supposed to of pushed a child into a &#034;road&#034; This this refers to the schools drive which has no cars on it, also considering we walk to school alone and 3 different ways, I dont see how this could happen without me seeing it.
One child was refusing to go to school because of my child - yeah right, 
my son is perfect in the classroom and playtime - he is currently there for 2 1/4 hours - so the teacher said. When I asked the teacher for more information on the road - which one was it etc she said she didnt know as they didnt say/ask.
This happened BEFORE the school bell rang and off school premises. I am really annoyed as my lil one has been allocated the same school for full time and dont want this following him. I have seen a child bully him in front of my eyes and when i mentioned it nothing was done but i am being told this that and the other.
Should I let this drop or take it further?
Also, in his school play he was being really good and he sang out at the top of his lungs - he was the only one doingthe actions or even singing properly be it loudly. but the teacher said he was being naughty cos he was pulling faces and singing too loudly. I definately stood up for him there! 
Even something as small as sitting on the carpet with his legs out gets him into trouble, does it really matter how he sits as long as he sits,

Sorry for the moan but i cant talk to anyone else? It is making me really resentful adn now none of the parents are talking to me, not that i care.Hi. My 4 yo has recently been accused of bullying.

Deleted profile,"I have posted on the potty training board about how the staff at our local village pre-school restrained my ds3 and cut his pants off with a pair of scissors because he had soiled and he was not co-operating when being changed. It is a long thread (over 200!:lol:) but things have moved on now - and I need to start this new thread - because basically the staff at the pre-school who are involved in this have begun using thier own children to bully my girls at school - to get at ME!

Ofsted have just completed thier investigation - no co-incidence really this is is? I recieved a letter last week on Friday saying that they had found failings in three areas- under welfare requirments and organisation they took 3 actions - basically putting new policies into place to safeguard children when toileting - they hadnt kept any accident records etc etc. 
The pre- school put out a letter to all the parents however - with a brief sentance about how a complaint had been raised but they were pleased to say Ofsted have completley exonerated the staff off all complaints made and new policy was in place to counter and prevent such claims in the future!! 

Then yesterday my DD8 and DD11 came home from school both were very upset saying that the DD's of these two women have been told not to be friends with them again - they have been excluded from 2 parties that are coming up soon and also are not allowed to speak to my DD's if they are playing out. We live in a small village - the school only has 6 girls in total in the Jr's and they all play together on the village green - so you can imagine how intense this situation is for us. My husband went straight to the school yesterday in a rage - he spoke to the teacher who is going to discuss this matter today with the headmaster - he is very good at sorting these things out so I am sure he will have them all in the office today and tell them that whilst IN school they are to all be friends - I do have a further problem though... 

The pre-school all walk up to the school lunch hall to eat lunch with the school children and so these women who have thier kids at the school -are working with my DD's every day - and yesterday one of them totally ignored my DD8 when she asked her a question, and she moved her own DD onto another table so she wasnt sitting next to my DD. the two girls have always sat together and my DD8 said to me &#034;x's mum keeps looking at me in a funny way mummy - like she is cross with me but i dont know what ive done??&#034; I am LIVID! The pre-school is charity run by a parent commitee - (the chairman is useless so no chance of me raising this with him) - so the headmaster has NOTHING to do with the employment or disciplining of the staff there - yet they all eat together in his school each day - so does he have any powers to intervene here? I basically feel like saying I dont want my girls having any contact with these women, if they are in his school then surely he can do something? - Im not asking them to come home for lunch - thats excluding them from thier friends and I dont see why they should suffer and let these ******* win?

They are basically cowardly bullies - using their children to get to me via my children all because I dared to complain about thier disgusting practises at the pre-school. There is so much more to this story - anyone who followed my other thread will know - but now I am faced with these women making my children suffer for a complaint I made about them.

I asked him what was wrong and at first he said nothing but one of his friends said this boy X was pushing him around at playtime, then it was easter but since he has gone back the boy has headbutted him, tried to bite him, broke one of his trucks, pulling his paper away when working at school they are at the same table.

lyn81eoe,"Hi everyone
I've never posted here before so please help I'm desperate!!
My 13 year old son had a falling out with one of his friends during the easter holidays. The boy in question was just mean to him and called him some names. We thought it was a one off incident but it wasn't. We have been on holiday so my son missed the first week back of school and during this time the boy in question has gone round all of their friends and told them not to like my son!! Have explained that it will all pass and he has a couple of friends who have taken no notice of this boy but the majority are now saying to him they don't like him Not sure what to do, don't want to wade in and go to school or anything in case I make it worse but really don't want this to continue or get worse. I couldn't sleep last night cause I'm so worried about him. Please is there any advice you can all give me
Thanks

Mel07xhq,"Does anyone elses child have trouble with the school bus journey.
The free school bus journey to and from school is like a bus full of monkey s, unsupervised and do as they please,the school is well aware of the behaviour of the children on this service ,it's been going on for years, on and off different bunch of kids, the bus company is aware and not so long ago said they fit cctv and would stop the service if need be.it ranges from bullying, missle throwing down the length of the bus and hitting all the heads of the kids who are sitting further down ,one day they were playing cricket with a corky like ball,someone got hit hard by that.Milkshakes and old litter they find on the bus gets thrown.
On and off there has been lots of little incidents , getting hit by sweets etc etc my daughter is 12 and a very quiet girl ,she has to sit on the bus where there is an available seat , not many as the bus is always full and it's a double decker and believe it or not but the older and sensible kids fill it up downstairs,she has recently had to swap her seat on the bus due to older girls wanting my daughters usual place due to being annoyed by the year 7 kids.
My daughter has had to endure these certain boys bitting rubbers and spitting it at her all the way home and wouldn,t stop when asked , then they threw a lollipop with stick in her hair which she had to yank out of her hair , this is all done to the laughs and enjoyment of the other animals (lol pupils) on the bus,she came home stressed from school over it and when she told me the full tale she had trouble on the morning journey too by the same 2 boys who were actually sat 3 seats down from her and one of the boys kept leaning forward and smacking her head on the window ,i,m so livid and couldn,t tell you how i really would like to deal with this lol but ive rung the school nobody available to talk about it try tomorrow morning .Don,t know what to do as i,m boiling here and have a good mind to go knocking on this boys door and have it out with parents . I can,t take her to school myself as i have another child at primary and i can,t be in 2 places at once.The school will i know have talks with these boys but in the past when kids been reported the whole bus finds out and the usual banter develops, grass etc.This bus is reknowed for bad behaviour but the kids all end up doing as they please on it .They should bring back bus inspectors but probaly won,t due to costs.
The bus has to pass my house on it's way home and from my window i can see it's like a zoo lol kids all up out of their seats , lots of activity going on.

Sar42ugu,"Hello

my daughter is 5 and in primary 1. We are having some issues at school. she is a spirited, headstrong girl and doesn't always listen to what she is told. The school though operates a misbehaviour chart and is sending home slips every week telling me how much time she has lost from her Friday afternoon free time due to bad behaviour. I find it all a bit negative.

more seriously though. Last week she told me a teacher remonstrated with her brandishing a pair of scissors. I spoke to the head and she said she would speak to the teacher but when i spoke to the teacher, she said the head hadn't mentioned it (great!). 

Then yesterday, she told me another teacher grabbed her shirt andput her face right in hers so close (like she was going to kiss her, is what my daughter said) because she was taking too long to put her coat on. I wanted to speak to head today but she is off so i have written a formal complaint letter. 

does anyone else think this is really bad? I am very upset and angry. what the heck is going on? does anyone else have this sort of experience?

Thanks - it really helps to talk!Hellomy daughter is 5 and in primary 1. We are having some issues at school. she is a spirited, headstrong girl and doesn't always listen to what she is told.

my middle DD, 2 and a half, started pre-school in January.

She was quite upset, and I feel gutted for her. She is a nice natured, sociable girl, so why these kids would do this, I dont know. I think i should speak to the teachers, but I dont want to make an issue of it as it may be a one-off incident.

Im so worried about sending her next week. I did make enquiries about another local pre-school, but was politely told to s*d off as we are not in the catchment area.:(

Also, should they e teaching letters, numbers, etc? DD1's pre-school did, ut this one doesnt.

ANN25qrj,"Hi,

My daughter is 6 years old, and has been friends with a little girl since toddler group. There is now another child that wants to be best friends with this little girl and my daughter is saying shes being pushed out. Every time she goes to play with her friend this other child pushes in, won't let her be partners with her friend, is picking her up and dropping her on the floor, has pinched her on the arm and generally pokes and prods at her. She has also said several hurtful things to my daughter.

I have spoken to the class teacher, who says shes keeping an eye on things, but one minute they're playing together happily, the next minute its got all spiteful again. We've tried telling my daughter to go and play with someone else and to tell this child not to pick her up, but it doesn't seem to be working.

Anyone got any suggestions, as this is beginning to get me down, and my daughter is so small compared to some of the others, she doesn't seem to be able to stand up to some of the others. I can't believe that 6 year olds can be so spiteful.Hi,My daughter is 6 years old, and has been friends with a little girl since toddler group.

Haylie Y,"I have a 9 year old son who is experiencing racism at school. Since October last year we have had at least 7 incidents of him being racially abused by one particluar girl in his class.

I am at my wits end with it and am really fustrated as to what to do. I have had meetings after meetings about this and seem to get the same response time and time again. That this girl has problems at home, her parents are struggling to cope etc etc. I do feel for her but it is not my son's fault and he is a caring child who rarely gets into any kind of trouble.

They have been punishing the girl in question, she has been internally excluded for 3 days 4 times now and officially excluded out of school for a day once.

Today she was on an internal exclusion where she has to sit with the head all day but for some unknown reason she still managed to escape, find my son on the playground and call him racial names. I have spoken again the the deputy head today who said that it has been logged and the girls will again be internally excluded next week for the whole week.

It seems she is getting the same punishment again and again and basically my son has to put up and shut up!

If anyone has some advice on who I can contact regarding this it would really help.

Sorry for going on and on but I have really had enough.

Sar14smx,"Hello Everyone,

I'm new to this site, and really need your help. I have a daughter who was 4 in June 08. She started in Reception class in September 08 and after 3 weeks of settling in she got along great, we even had tears at the christmas holidays as she didn't want to stop going to school!

But it's now all gone wrong! :(
My daughters teacher changed after xmas and its gone down hill ever since. We have tears every morning and when we walk through the school gates I can feel her little hand squeeze mine even harder as we approach the school! 
My daughter is a good girl, very polite (does have her momets.. don't they all! :lol:) but bit by bit she is telling me things about a teacher in Kindergarden. The most disturbing is that this teacher pinched her. She also says that this teacher stares at her and then my daugter did an impression of what she does, rolling her eyes round her sockets. My daughter is only 4, and wouldnt have a clue what eye rolling is meant to mean. 
Her dad has recently been taking her into school as I have been in hospital and she came home in fllods of tears saying this teacher had told her if she doesnt eat her dinner she is going to take her off Daddy???? What is all that about??? 
 This is so difficult, I know it is so easy for children to get the wrong end of the stick, but I also can't ignore what my daughter is telling me. 

Like any parent I want my daughter to be happy and do well at school so any help and advice would be much appreciated.

vickie w(11),"I am really worried about my daughter, My neighbours kids (the boy is yr 6 the girl is year 7) have started being really mean to my daughter, she has SN and the kids are using that as a get out clause.

Any way the kids all used to be friends and I was with the mother but the friendship ended when she accused me of reporting her to SS although she deserved it for the way she treated her kids anyway I was glad when the friendship ended as I noticed she was just plain weird, now her kids are picking on my daughter except that it is on the school bus and the school has said they cant do anything as untill they are in school its not their responsibility but they would have a word (at this point it was just the boy) I kept telling DD ignore him until it got physical pushing and shoving and blocking DD onto the road. I decided even though I was not on speaking terms with the mother that I would go and talk to her try to sort things out like adults:bang::bang: I decided at this point i would take DD off the bus to let things cool down. The next thing I get was a letter through the post (they would have had to walk past my house to post it) saying I was trespassing and if I contacted them again then they would call the police and I would be done for harassment 


Any way the bit that is really worring me is that for the last 3 days the oldest one the girl has been really obnoxious moving seats to kick and punch the back of the chair and giving DD death stares. Where am I left to go with this?? I cant talk to the parents, the school have said they cant do an awful lot, so I have been reporting these things to the police I have 3 reference numbers from the last 3 days so the police have called the parents.

I know this is a really long post but I am in need of getting this all down to make sense of it and hopefully get some sleep. The good news out of all of this is that DD and the boy are on talking terms again :nmswoo: but because they are talking the girl is telling her brother not to talk to DD its their mums rules I am really worried that it will get much worse now.

Daw80qna,"My who is now 10 has never had close friends but was friendly with most kids in his year. 3 years ago we moved house and he changed schools, he started hanging around with his cousin at break time, his cousin is in a different class and DS never made friends in his own class. Last year we found that DS was being bullied by several kids in his class, I eventually got the school to deal with it and the bullying has stopped but he doesn't have any friends other than his cousin and he gets excluded from games and has never had a party invite and his self esteem is really low.. 

Now I've found that his cousins other friend is being nasty to my son at playtime and sometimes his cousin joins in, they call him names, make up stories about him to tell other people and the boy keeps getting my son in a head lock. When they're not being nasty to my son they go around the school yard &#034;annoying&#034; the other children. My son has no one else to hang around with so he's been joining in, No wonder he hasn't any friends!!! Also we've found that he will do anything someone tells him too because his confidence his so low, he wont say no.

Now I find myself in an awfull situation, I want to tell my son to stay away from his cousin and this other boy but he has no one else to hang around and because he's been joining in annoying other children they don't want to know.

My son is a really nice lad but a little immature and very sensitive, he wants to distance himself from his cousin and the boy but he doesn't want to be alone. School are being a little better these days but I'm not sure what they or I can do to help my son make some real friends.My who is now 10 has never had close friends but was friendly with most kids in his year.  3 years ago we moved house and he changed schools, he started hanging around with his cousin at break time, his cousin is in a different class and DS never made friends in his own class.  Last year we found that DS was being bullied by several kids in his class, I eventually got the school to deal with it and the bullying has stopped but he doesn't have any friends other than his cousin and he gets excluded from games and has never had a party invite and his self esteem is really low..  Now I've found that his cousins other friend is being nasty to my son at playtime and sometimes his cousin joins in,  they call him names, make up stories about him to tell other people and the boy keeps getting my son in a head lock.  When they're not being nasty to my son they go around the school yard ""annoying"" the other children.  My son has no one else to hang around with so he's been joining in, No wonder he hasn't any friends!!!  Also we've found that he will do anything someone tells him too because his confidence his so low, he wont say no.Now I find myself in an awfull situation, I want to tell my son to stay away from his cousin and this other boy but he has no one else to hang around and because he's been joining in annoying other children they don't want to know.My son is a really nice lad but a little immature and very sensitive, he wants to distance himself from his cousin and the boy but he doesn't want to be alone.  School are being a little better these days but I'm not sure what they or I can do to help my son make some real friends.",14,"14,743", 29-06-2007 at 1.38AM  
E C(2),"My 9 yr old son is having problems at his after school swim class. He is a popular, happy boy but not the rough and tumble type. After changing swim class 3 boys about the same age (and not from his school) are giving him problems. As he is Yr5 he's can't come in the ladies changing rooms anymore .
 Last week when popping my head round the door to say where I’d meet him I saw another boy pushing and shoving my lad in the showers and the 2 other lads laughing. I simply said &#034;I hope you lot are being sensible&#034; to which the pusher looked very sheepish and immediately apologized. I talked to him about it later and although he was a bit shocked by what happended, he seemed ok.

This week, after waiting ages for my normally quick son to get changed, I gave him a shout to ask if he was ok. I could tell from the tone of his voice that something wasn't right. When he came out he explained that the boys wouldn't let him in the showers and had been spitting at him, he'd walked away - waited a while then gone back, they still wouldn’t let him in. He’d then gone into a cubicle to change and 2 of the lads started repeatedly banging the cubicle door open and not letting him get dressed (no locks). This may all sound pretty light weight but my son felt very threatened by it. 
As he finished telling me what had happened 1 of the lads and his dad came out. I very politely said I understood that there been some spitting and problems in the changing rooms this week. Looking at his father I pointed out that there had been problem the previous week too. The father simply commented he hadn't seen any spitting. I addressed the boy and asked about the banging of the door, he said he had yes been doing that but not the spitting. I said it wasn’t a kind thing to do that and that I was really unhappy about it and I asked him not to do it again. The father just stood there looking away from me. To be honest my speaking to them was completely spur of the moment ( I didn’t want to leave it till the following week). It only occurred to me later that the father had said he’d not seen any spitting and therefore he must have seen the harassment in the cubicle which is probably why he didn’t defend his son. If I’d seen my son was doing what his son had done I would of said “come on lads – stopped messing about” to prevent it from going any further. I didn’t see the parents of the other boys. 

I have praised my son on telling me what had happened (it must've been bad 'cos he wouldn't normally have opened up so quickly). Now my son is now very wary of going in the changing rooms on his own. Should I have said anything? I want to nip this in the bud but I also want to give my son the tools to try and deal with this type of thinghimself as he goes up to high school in Sept.

Rac97jbo,"My 8 year old DS is becoming really anxious about going to school as a couple of boys in particular are really nasty to him. He is &#034;not allowed&#034; to join in games, is called names, kicked, pushed etc. Never an overly confident child (although often hidden with an I don't care attitude) this is naturally eating away at him. 

After telling myself &#034;these things happen / got to learn to deal with it / not really bullying surely&#034; for a while, being snowed in this week has given my son the chance to tell me more about what has been going on (it's often difficult to get him to say what's happened).

Two, he has been told the two (much older) brothers of one child &#034;will get him&#034;.

Vic55mbx,"My daughter started reception last September (2008). For various reasons she didn’t go to her local school so she didn’t know very many children in her class. But she is very friendly and made lots of friends, and is included on party invites and after school play dates. She loves school we have never had an issue with her going and her teachers say she is doing really one.

Anyway last week she asked me if she could have a new lunch box.? She has an in-the-night-garden lunch box, which she was delighted with, when her Gran brought it for her as a going to school present. When I asked why, she said that some of the children at dinner time said it’s just for babies? I asked her if that was some of the older children in the school – by the way this is a very small school Reception is a mixed class with some of the younger year 1 children and the whole school have dinners together. But she said it wasn’t but children in her class. In particular a little girl she would probably regard as her best friend – my daughter is going to her house this week! 

Should I be worried about this? Is this a form of bullying? What should I do? Currently I’m not giving in and buying a new lunch box and just saying if she likes it I won’t worry. 

I have no experience of this and was a little shocked to be honest.

I went to talk to my sons teacher today as he is being picked on at school, 3 boys have been hitting him, pushing him against the wall, and even pushed him over a bench in the playground yesterday.

This is what the teacher said to me!

 &#034;i am glad you used the word picked on and not bullied as we dont use the word bullied because its labelling a child as a bully!!&#034; 

I thought if a child bullies other children he/she is classed as a flipping bully but anyway this was his response to my son being PICKED (!!!) on!

 &#034;Well its probably because he is so small but i will tell one of the teaching assistants to keep an eye out as i dont go into the playground&#034; 

Ummmm do i have reason to be annoyed?! Talk about unhelpful.

So i told him he had better keep an eye out because if it carries on i will be back to talk to him and the head if i have to.

emm82nne,"My daughter was bullied last year at school and outside of school, but she didn't tell us for a few months that she was beinng bullied as her nan had just died and her grandad was living with us and he had terminal lung cancer and she said she didn't want to worry us. Basically the child lived across the road from us (they moved August last year), and he had been hitting and punching her, and saying to her &#034;your nans died and now your grandads going to die&#034;, rubbing it in just a bit to much for my liking. Anyway it all came out when one day he hit her over the head with a stick and she came in crying and told me everything. I then went to see the parents and just explained he'd hit her on the head and had said some horrible things and basically I was told to go away - won't say what the dad said but you can guess. So I said I would have to have a word with the school when they went back (it was during summer holidays) and again he told me where to go.

First day back at school, saw the teacher about it, who said I should see head teacher and it turned out another child was being bullied by the child who was bullying my child and there had been on going problems with the bully for the past 3 years - basically since he had been at school. Head Teacher had the parents in talked to them, but it continued for a week, spitting in the face, name calling and punching, but then it stop. That was a year ago.

Well my OH and I decided to go out on Saturday night with our friends who had just moved over here from Spain and also a few other people we know and we all decided to split up girls &amp; boys and meet up later, back in the same place we started at, which is normally where we go anyway (taking into account I've only had 6 nights out in 8 years). Well all the girls get back to the pub and we are having drinks waiting for the boys to turn up and some pushes me and look round and see the father of the boy who was bullying my daughter. I mentioned to my friend I don't feel confortable with his happening and then the boys turn up, so I go over the my OH and tell him what happens and we decide to go home. But he needs to go to toilet which he did and I was thinking he'd been a long time, then he comes back with blood coming out of his nose and said the bullies dad had followed him into the toilets and hit him. So then we tell our friends we are going who decided to come with us as they live near and we share a taxi. However I turn round to check they are coming and bang I'm hit in the face, fall to the fall and hit my head and hurt my shoulder. My OH trys to help me up and it turns out the bullies mother had hit me and was coming for me again.

My OH gets me up quick and puts his hand out to stop her and we head for the door. Once outside I call the police and I'm told they won't be able to attend as the pub is too busy and it would put their officers at risk going in there. I've now waited 18 hours for the police to contact me since the 999 call, so I have called them and am now awaiting for a call back. 

I am so depressed at this whole situation, how can anyone do that to me and my family. I have left a message on the answer machine at the school asking for someone to call me back so that I can make an urgent meeting with the head teacher and explain what happened. I know myself or my OH would not do anything back to them as we are not like that, but I am really worried they might do something else at the school or outside the grounds of the school and I would hate for any young child to see it.

I know I've gone on a bit, but I am so down, can anyone offer any adviseMy daughter was bullied last year at school and outside of school, but she didn't tell us for a few months that she was beinng bullied as her nan had just died and her grandad was living with us and he had terminal lung cancer and she said she didn't want to worry us.  Basically the child lived across the road from us (they moved August last year), and he had been hitting and punching her, and saying to her ""your nans died and now your grandads going to die"", rubbing it in just a bit to much for my liking.  Anyway it all came out when one day he hit her over the head with a stick and she came in crying and told me everything.  I then went to see the parents and just explained he'd hit her on the head and had said some horrible things and basically I was told to go away - won't say what the dad said but you can guess.  So I said I would have to have a word with the school when they went back (it was during summer holidays) and again he told me where to go.First day back at school, saw the teacher about it, who said I should see head teacher and it turned out another child was being bullied by the child who was bullying my child and there had been on going problems with the bully for the past 3 years - basically since he had been at school.  Head Teacher had the parents in talked to them, but it continued for a week, spitting in the face, name calling and punching, but then it stop.  That was a year ago.Well my OH and I decided to go out on Saturday night with our friends who had just moved over here from Spain and also a few other people we know and we all decided to split up girls & boys and meet up later, back in the same place we started at, which is normally where we go anyway (taking into account I've only had 6 nights out in 8 years).  Well all the girls get back to the pub and we are having drinks waiting for the boys to turn up and some pushes me and look round and see the father of the boy who was bullying my daughter.  I mentioned to my friend I don't feel confortable with his happening and then the boys turn up, so I go over the my OH and tell him what happens and we decide to go home.  But he needs to go to toilet which he did and I was thinking he'd been a long time, then he comes back with blood coming out of his nose and said the bullies dad had followed him into the toilets and hit him.  So then we tell our friends we are going who decided to come with us as they live near and we share a taxi.  However I turn round to check they are coming and bang I'm hit in the face, fall to the fall and hit my head and hurt my shoulder.  My OH trys to help me up and it turns out the bullies mother had hit me and was coming for me again.My OH gets me up quick and puts his hand out to stop her and we head for the door.  Once outside I call the police and I'm told they won't be able to attend as the pub is too busy and it would put their officers at risk going in there.  I've now waited 18 hours for the police to contact me since the 999 call, so I have called them and am now awaiting for a call back.  I am so depressed at this whole situation, how can anyone do that to me and my family.  I have left a message on the answer machine at the school asking for someone to call me back so that I can make an urgent meeting with the head teacher and explain what happened.  I know myself or my OH would not do anything back to them as we are not like that, but I am really worried they might do something else at the school or outside the grounds of the school and I would hate for any young child to see it.I know I've gone on a bit, but I am so down, can anyone offer any advise",28,"6,677", 30-09-2007 at 8.05PM  
Hel99oez,"Hi there, My ds is a very quiet ,non confrontational little boy who has been loving school, but since he has gone to year 1 the classes have joined together and a boy who was in the other reception class last year is now with my ds . ds has told me tonight that boy threatens to get someone to beat him up at playtime and/or after school. I do know this boy is quite a rough and tumble boy. But my ds has said some times it makes him cry if this happens, I think sometimes his other little friend steps in for him when he has been upset. Tried to get information out of ds without making it into a big issue. I have told him to move away and ignore him and he says that is what he does. He has also mentioned this to my DH while I have been away. I don't really know what to do, Have I done enough for now ?? I have told him no one will get him after school as I pick him up and would see this and to tell a teacher at playtime ,(no hitting has taken place just threats) and then just try and keep on top of the situation. If boys are play fighting he doesn't really get involved he never has, he does have other little friends which I have also reassured him with tonight. Most grateful for advice.

Eli36ave,"My dd came home last week saying shes being bullied by a girl in her class,the girl was throwing paper in her hair-Saying some horrid things to her making her feel really crap and turned everyone in the class against her. Last night we was walking past the girl and her mother, the girl called my child a f*** tramp so i stopped and said to the girl dont worry im just about to see the head about you bullying my daughter her mother didnt say 1 word. I then approached the head (who i have never seen eye to eye with since my child started the school) who said it would get sorted out so i left it. This Morning i walked my child upto her class there was 10 girls waiting for her to beat her up (i heard them say shes coming lets get her) when they seen me they ran off so i approached them and said any of you touch 1 hair on her head then you will know about it. I went back to the head told her what had happened yet again all she said she would deal with it.
I had a phone call at mid-day to say the head needed to see me after school, I went and was told that a report had been made against me by the girls in the gang that i had hit one of them,swore and threatned them, I explained that none of this had happened and i would never even hit my own child let alone anyone elses and i would never swear in front of a child as i know if i did my 2 yr old would copy me. She then proceed to give me a warning letter against myself and said she didnt believe i hadnt done what the child had said basically took there word over mine. Then said she would not deal with my daughters problem anymore and told me to go to the police instead, i feel i am being made to be the bad one when i havent done anything wrong apart from preventing my daughter from being beat up. I want to take this futher but feel if the head has anything to do with it she will make things out to be 10x worse does anybody have any advice please

Sal22ivr,"Hi all.
Im new to this Forum. Ive been looking for a site where I can ask for advice on Bullying.
My 8 year old son is being bullied by our neighbors children. There are 4 of them in total ranging from aged 5 to aged 10. This started back in March when a family of Travellers were housed by Norwich City Council into the house adjoining us. 
I will keep the details fairly brief as it would take too long to write about everything, but my son has been headbutted, beaten with sticks, punched and kicked. He is now scared to go outside when the children from next door are outside, but he cannot even play in our own garden as the kids just go out into their garden and shout vile abuse at him and throw stones, tomatos and eggs etc at him. They are picking on him because he is a little overweight and insecure.
We have tried to talk to the parents but we have just been threatened by them and told that our son is too F***in soft. The children fight extremely aggressively (like street fighting), not the usual push and shove that other children of that age might do. We got in touch with the police who then went to speak to the parents. Since then the father has given us Death threats and the bullying has gotten worse for our son. The police have agreed that something needs to be done but say that because our neighbors children are under the age of 11 they cannot do anything about the bullying. We have had to have a panic button installed in our house because of the death threats. 
My sons Father died when my son was only 3 and a half. He took his own life and my son has emotional problems because of this. Now that he is being bullied his emotional state is just getting worse and worse. Im at a loss as to what to do for him. 
Our neighbors children are being &#034;monitored&#034; by Social Security and I was wondering if I should get them involved with my family. I know there are a lot of bad opinions about them but after my husband died they did a lot to help me and my son. My son is waiting to have councilling to help with dealing with his dads death but whilst the bullying is going on he is becoming more and more withdrawn and aggressive.

Ter47rmy,"Very long story - my son is now 11 1/2 and recently started high school. 

during his last year at primary he had major problems with this one particular boy, on and off for the year. It started in June 2006 before they broke up for the summer. This boy was picking on a younger child and threw his hat over the fence, so my son put his hand through the fence to try and get the hat back. This boy goes up to him an kicks him really hard in the chest, resulting in my son twisting and cutting his arm open on the fence. The school did nothing as it was last day of term.

On returning to school after the summer, this boy went out of his way to make my sons life hell, twice we had to take my son to doctors because of bruising and swelling as a reslut of this boy hurting him. On one occasion we threw my sons swimming stuff on top of the lockers at the local pool and pushed my son against the lockers and threatened him. My son came home in a right state with marks all down his back. At this point the bullies parents got involved and made thier son come around and apologize. Things improved for a while. Then they slowly got worse again, just small things to start with like name calling, but from there got worse. My son came home with a footprint on his shoulder where his boy and stomped on him in a game of football. Again a visit to the doctors. His primary school where no a lot of help at all if anything they where not interested. 

Upon visiting the high school before he started we stated that we did not want my son to be placed in any of this boys classess and explained the situation. They have been very supportive. However in the last 3 weeks my son has been very withdrawn but at the same time angry with the world. We have had to pay a visit to A&amp;E in the last 3 weeks because he came home from school with his hand swollen, only got out of him last night what really happened, this boy has started again and his hand was a result of this boy kicking him in the hand, whilst he was sitting on ground eating his lunch. and yesterday he punched him. 

I am wits end what do i do? waiting to hear from school, but will this make matters worse? Do i involve police as it is now ABH?

...is this just the way things are now?

I can't remember it being like this when i first started school - and i'm wondering whether i'm being overly sensitive - what are your views?... i have a four year old - like a lot of other threads i'm reading we are also having a difficult time settling into school - all because of aggressive behaviour and bullying - it's not just that he's being bullied but he's becoming so aggressive... the school are really dealing with the situation and i'm quite relieved about that ... but why is this happening?...is this just the way things are now?I can't remember it being like this when i first started school - and i'm wondering whether i'm being overly sensitive - what are your views?",5,"1,690", 23-09-2008 at 4.36PM  
WEN17ivk,"You know, this bullying lark is getting out of hand. One of my daughters was bullied at two schools. The first was in primary. When they were moving up to secondary school (they are always put into new classes from feeder primaries in pairs) she was put with the girl that was bullying her!! Her confidence sank to an all time low. I was at school lots. We didn't want to make a fuss, and asked simply that this girl sit at one side of the class and my daughter at the other. They couldn't do that! They would have to give a reason to this girl for moving her! Deputy rector said that my daughter(who was very clever) should stand up in class and say she was falling behind with her work and ask to be sat at the front!! My daughter came to the conclusion that it was a waste of time telling me about the bullying because the teachers wouldn't do anything about it. Because it took her confidence, other girls then excluded her because she was quiet. The year teacher was always interested in the confident girls and those who had 'well - to - do' parents. I didn't know how to teach her to toughen up, as we are just a nice quiet family. Anyway, why should she change who she is because of other people. I wouldn't want her to be like them and nor would she. She came so close to commiting suicide. When she got into university, the year teacher asked her 'how did you manage that?'

jane x,"My son is 5 and has just started in year 1. He is a quiet boy and very placid. He doesnt have many friends although has always seemed to enjoy school, especially last year in reception. 
However this year so far he doesnt seem as keen. The 2 reception classes have doubled up into 1 class so there are now around 36 children in the class with 1 teacher, a lot different to last year. I thought it might be this bothering him, but on monday he came out of school with a red cheek, looked like he had been hit with something. I asked him what happened he said he couldnt remember, so I left it. Then yesterday he came out with a black eye! I went in to school and asked his teacher if she knew anything about it as my son didnt want to talk about it. She asked him what happened, he again said he couldnt remember. The teacher said she didnt know what had happened either.
Later last night my son told me it had happened at playtime. He said lots of boys kept bumping into him and pushing him. He named 1 in particular who I think is hitting him more than any others.

fel71pop,"Hi guys.really could do with some advise....
my daughter who is now 6 was bullied when she was in reception.I failed her as i never sorted it out as the other childs mother and i were friends.this so called friend of mine was very aggressive and i didnt always confront her because i was frightened she also was a terible bully to me too but never stuck for myself either!!
i eventually broke up our friendship for both mine and my daughters sake and then it finaly hit me the exstent of the bullying that i had let my daughter be subjected too.i got on to the school about it who insisted that 5 year old were incapable of bullying!a joke right!!!i asked them to seperate them in class which often did not happen as my daughter would still play with this child because no one else would and she didint want her to be lonely....very sad really.
i managed to get them put into different classes in year one and found this was great as my daughters confidence soared her work got better and she could now make friends as she wasnt allowed to have other friends when this other child was around- as you can tell this other child was very controlling!
now i have heard thru the holidays that this child has been placed back into the same class as my daughter as she was being bullied by another child in her class!
i dont know what to do...this child was very aggressive to my daughter mentally and physically and i feel the school has not had a single thought for my daughter and how this may affect her.im complelety lost and have even comtemplated moving her school before next week!please help.i know that i failed her before but am not willing to let it happen again i cant go to the other mother as she wouldnt care anyway and she is verHi guys.really could do with some advise....my daughter who is now 6 was bullied when she was in reception.I failed her as i never sorted it out as the other childs mother and i were friends.this so called friend of mine was very aggressive and i didnt always confront her because i was frightened she also was a terible bully to me too but never stuck for myself either!!i eventually broke up our friendship for both mine and my daughters sake and then it finaly hit me the exstent of the bullying that i had let my daughter be subjected too.i got on to the school about it who insisted that 5 year old were incapable of bullying!a joke right!!!i asked them to seperate them in class which often did not happen as  my daughter would still play with this child because no one else would and she didint want her to be lonely....very sad really.i managed to get them put into different classes in year one and found this was great as my daughters confidence soared her work got better and she could now make friends as she wasnt allowed to have other friends when this other child was around- as you can tell this other child was very controlling!now i have heard thru the holidays that this child has been placed back into the same class as my daughter as she was being bullied by another child in her class!i dont know what to do...this child was very aggressive to my daughter mentally and physically and i feel the school has not had a single thought for my daughter and how this may affect her.im complelety lost and have even comtemplated moving her school before next week!please help.i know that i failed her before but am not willing to let it happen again i cant go to the other mother as she wouldnt care anyway and she is ver[y unapproachable not even the school will talkj to her.please help!!![smilie=022.gif][smilie=022.gif​][smilie=022.gif][smilie=022.g​if]",7,"1,572", 28-08-2008 at 11.20AM

joanne r(185),"hi there
i was hoping to get some advice about my 8 yr old daughter who is being bullied in school.
She has been in this school since last may after we moved to a new area.it seemed like a good school and my 5 yr old son has had no problems being there but just before christmas (it might have been just after xmas i can't be sure) my eldest came home and told us that a girl had strangled and her in the girls toilets we went to the school and everything calmed down so we thought that would be the last of it.
Except last week my eldest wanted me to take her to the head master as she had something to say.when we got there she started crying and told us that 2 boys had been picking on her and calling her a 'geek' 'freak' 'goody goody' 'stupid' 'four eyes' and 'ugly' all because she wears glasses (shes short sighted) she also said she was put off wearing her glasses in school. the next day the head master had pulled these 2 boys up and they apologised. Again we thought it was over. But today my daughter told me that the girl who had strangled her tried doing it again at lunch time and told her she wanted a fight. Older kids in year 6 gathered in a circle and encouraged a fight but a teacher stopped it. 
my daughter had left her glasses in class at dinner time and when she went back for them they were gone.they are still missing now. i once again went to see the headmaster and he spoke to me like i was a kid myself and was quite clearly in a rush to get somewhere else.
I have decided to keep her off school tomorrow and my partner said he is going to the school himself in the morning as he didn't like how i was spoken to either. She can't see the black/white board without her glasses on even if she is at the front of the room and she can't read her school book or watch tv so her night is ruined and she doesn't know what else to do with herself.
i was bullied in school for nearly 5 years and i never stood up for myself i just put up with it even though i have suffered depression on and off ever since (i am now 27) i am worried this will happen to her so i don't know what to do for the best. i can't keep changing her schools although i say i will find a new place.
i am debating whether or not ot teach her at home but let her carry on going to cubs,football and her other out of school activities so she still has some connection with children her age. i know this would all be a last straw if i was to do it this way.
Has anyone got any advice on how i can handle this better as i don't want to make it worse for her. Shes extremely bright (one of the top in her class) i don't want her falling behind which is what happened to me. 
please help if possible.
thank you

mar49ill,"Hi everyone,
My son (4) attends nursery 4 days a week and has done so for the past 6 months.
He has made some lovely friends in this time but recently he has been very quiet about talking about them. When I ask about what he's been doing or playing with he answers that his freinds all run away from him and won't play with him.....
We've had these boys over to house to play and my son has been to one of theirs too.
I mentioned this about a month ago to the teacher who said she'd keep an eye and make sure they were all playing nicely, but it does'nt seem to make any difference.
He is still telling me that his &#034;freinds&#034; run away and won't play with him.

Am I being over sensitive? should I let it smooth itself out? or say something again.
I know both the mum's reasonably well - should I talk to them?

I tell him to go and play with someone else and that if that's the way they want to play just ignore it, but he doesnt really understand whats going on.

It breaks my heart to think that he's getting anxious about it. 

Any advice would be brilliant - I don't know what to do.Hi everyone,My son (4) attends nursery 4 days a week and has done so for the past 6 months.He has made some lovely friends in this time but recently he has been very quiet about talking about them.

kir79uuc,"My DD started nursery on 17 Jan, exactly one month after her third birthday. She is in nursery in the mornings with the &#034;older&#034; children. A few weeks ago she started talking about 2 girls in particular and has gradually being saying things like they have told her they don't want to play with her, well kids can be like that so I didn't pay too much attention, then she said that they were pushing her when she wanted to play. I saw the nursery teacher, I never named names and she seemed to know who I was talking about and said she would keep an eye on it.

Last week DD wet herself 2 days in a row, the teacher said that on one of the days she was absorbed in playing and DD said on the other day that she hadn't got her pants down in time, I never thought any more of it. Until this morning...

In the car she asked if the two bullies would be at the nursery today, I asked who she meant and she named the 2 girls, I said to her not to play with them to play with someone else, then she said she was crying in the toilets last week, when I asked her why she said that the girls wouldn't let her in to do the toilet, so I asked if that was when she had wet herself and she said yes.

So the upshot is, these twins have bullied my DD by not letting her into the toilet and she peed herself. When I spoke to the nursery teacher she said &#034;we don't use that word (bully)&#034; I am sorry but what other word can be used for it??

She then said that she was going to speak to the whole class and tell them that if anything happens to tell a teacher right away and not leave it until later. For god's sake, my DD is 3 and 2 months and gets the days mixed up - is that such a crime? I feel like DD is the victim and yet we have to all pussyfoot around the bullies.

She also said I have to speak to DD and tell her if anything like that happens again. I never heard the teacher saying they were going to speak to the bullies. If this is what they are like at 4 I dread to think what they will be like in a few years time!

I am seriously thinking about pulling her out the nursery and putting her back into playgroup. Life is hard enough without her being bullied at only 3. It's like she had only 3 innocent years of her life and surely that isn't right.

Sorry for rambling on, I just don't know what I should be doing. It's like everything has to be so PC these days that everyone is treating the victim as the bully.My DD started nursery on 17 Jan, exactly one month after her third birthday.  She is in nursery in the mornings with the ""older"" children.  A few weeks ago she started talking about 2 girls in particular and has gradually being saying things like they have told her they don't want to play with her, well kids can be like that so I didn't pay too much attention, then she said that they were pushing her when she wanted to play.  I saw the nursery teacher, I never named names and she seemed to know who I was talking about and said she would keep an eye on it.Last week DD wet herself 2 days in a row, the teacher said that on one of the days she was absorbed in playing and DD said on the other day that she hadn't got her pants down in time, I never thought any more of it.  Until this morning...In the car she asked if the two bullies would be at the nursery today, I asked who she meant and she named the 2 girls, I said to her not to play with them to play with someone else, then she said she was crying in the toilets last week, when I asked her why she said that the girls wouldn't let her in to do the toilet, so I asked if that was when she had wet herself and she said yes.So the upshot is, these twins have bullied my DD by not letting her into the toilet and she peed herself.  When I spoke to the nursery teacher she said ""we don't use that word (bully)"" I am sorry but what other word can be used for it??She then said that she was going to speak to the whole class and tell them that if anything happens to tell a teacher right away and not leave it until later.   For god's sake, my DD is 3 and 2 months and gets the days mixed up - is that such a crime?  I feel like DD is the victim and yet we have to all pussyfoot around the bullies.She also said I have to speak to DD and tell her if anything like that happens again.  I never heard the teacher saying they were going to speak to the bullies.  If this is what they are like at 4 I dread to think what they will be like in a few years time!I am seriously thinking about pulling her out the nursery and putting her back into playgroup.  Life is hard enough without her being bullied at only 3.  It's like she had only 3 innocent years of her life and surely that isn't right.Sorry for rambling on, I just don't know what I should be doing.  It's like everything has to be so PC these days that everyone is treating the victim as the bully.",6,"8,725", 05-03-2008 at 9.50PM

Rachel W(32),"About 4 or 5 months ago a group of 5 girls started bullying my 9 year old DD at school. Basically my parents were going to buy the house of one of the bullies parents but pulled out of the sale as an extension hadn't been built to planning permission, and as soon as this happened the woman stopped talking to me and her dd started bullying my daughter. All of the bullies mums are in a clique:roll:

DD has other friends at school and enjoys school in general so if the bullying would stop then she would be fine. I have told her to just ignore the bullies. We have been up the school on numerous occasions but the school have done/will do very little about it. I have also approached a couple of the parents and they insist that it is my DD bullying those 5 girls. Yeah, right!:roll: DD has been kicked, pushed, punched, name-called, friends have been told not to play with her, the list goes on and on and on. Only last week she was pushed by all 5 of them off a climbing frame and I went straight in to see her teacher who said &#034;well, what did you do to deserve it&#034;

I have been thinking about moving her to another school but she only has a couple of years left until secondary school, where she will see these bullies again anyway, and also why should she leave a school she likes, where she has friends, because of these 5 nasty girls?

So, I have been telling her to ignore these girls for now. She has tried having a go back at them and I think it is the reaction they want. I told her to just look at them in disgust and walk away. Do you think this is the right thing to do and they will just get bored? I have told DD to just focus on the lovely friends that she does have, and that it's better to just have a few proper friends than try and please everyone. I just feel so sorry for her, yesterday she went to a party and 2 of the bullies were there and they were nasty to her for the whole time, then when one of the bullies' dads came to pick her up the bully started crying and saying my DD had been nasty to her.

Katrina S(11),"When my son, (now in Year 7) was in Year 5 he was approached in the playground one day by a notorious child, who I will call John, and his group of friends, They accused my son of 'looking at them funny' and then one of them punched him in the privates. This made my son cry because obviously it hurt and shocked him. My sons not a fighter at all - he runs a mile from confrontation.John was sent into detention.

I was a Teaching Assistant at the same school at the time and when my son came down to my class and told me what had gone on I was furious and went down to the class of the boy concerned to speak to the teacher. She was sitting marking work at the time and barely even looked up as I told her why I was there. She just kept repeating 'Its been sorted as far as Im concerned, its been sorted as far as im concerned'.

I thought this was a one off situation but throughout the next year there was the odd bit of trouble between my son and John. I spoke to Johns anger management mentor a couple of times and she said she'd have a word but nothing ever seemed to change.I didnt feel I could approach Johns mother as she'd actually had a physical fight with another woman in the playground before and certainly didnt seem approachable.

Then this September my son started secondary school and was loving it till John started to single him out in a way much worse than before. My son was threatened with violence on a daily basis. He was surrounded by John and his group of equally undesirable friends and terrorised. He had food he was eating knocked out of his hands, was kicked in the back of the legs as he was walking to class and called vulgar names. Any friends of my sons who tried to stick up for him were called names too.

After reporting it to several teachers/year heads etc nothing was changing. I was getting headaches most days worrying about what was happening at the school. One evening I had nipped to the post office and saw John swaggering along the street.I dont know whether I did the right thing but I couldnt contain myself. I screamed at him and demanded to know what the problem was - of course he denied all knowledge but that was no surprise.I screamed that he had better leave my son alone or face serious consequences (I hadnt had time to plan what they would actually be but itd be something unpleasant lol).

The next day I knew I had to demand something was done at the school as Im really not the type to be in the habit of shouting at kids in the street! I emailed the school and asked for the head to phone me back about a serious case of bullying. He called back within the hour and asked me many many details. The following day John was excluded for a week and my son was called into the head teachers office and the head teacher had a good talk with him about holding his head high and reporting anything regarding this child to him directly as the chilld had apparently been doing the same thing to many others.

Since that day my son has had no trouble with John, the icing in the cake was the other day when John approached him and said 'alright mate?'. I mean theyll never be friends or anything but it was a break through i suppose.

Sorry if Ive waffled with this. Having a child thats being bullied can be soul destroying so i just thought i would share this to let people know there can be a light at the end of the tunnel - you just need to find the right person to help you sometimes.When my son, (now in Year 7) was in Year 5 he was approached in the playground one day by a notorious child, who I will call John, and his group of friends, They accused my son of 'looking at them funny' and then one of them punched him in the privates.

Jac72gtx,"Any advice on this one? When my 5 yo son was in the bath tonight he had 14 new large fresh bruises on his legs apparently administered by one boy kicking him in his class, in the classroom during 'independent learning'. 

I am absolutely furious - the boy in question also kicked a girl at the same time, whose parents may well have made an equally unfortunate discovery tonight.

The bruises are so obviously intentionally done if I took my son to the doctors in this state I would be reported to the social services.

Of course I will be cornering his teacher tomorrow - but has anyone out there any advice on how to make sure this is not just brushed under the carpet.

Incidently this is not at a 'sink' school, it's one of the best schools in the county.

To the extent where I have heard them in the classroom and the playground saying to her 'no ..... i don't want you to sit next to me' and 'no, i don't want to play with you' or don't stand next to me, i want .... to stand next to me not you' 
My daughter says shes doesn't like school and looks forward to weekends etc
The problem seems to be that she is exceptionally big for her age (she is 4 years old and 4 ft 2ins - she wears a size 6-8 years)
the other girls are all small and very girly girls, maybe they are overwelmed or intimidated by my daughters size but what can she do? she can't shrink!
the girls all very clicky in the group and its breaking my heart to see my daughter being kept on the outside of the 'group'. The school will not be simpathetic to this, I have mentioned it to the teacher and the head but they blank it and pretend its my imagination. they have said all little girls are difficult socially and it goes both ways but other mums of boys have spoken to me about this problem - even they've noticed it!

Mic62ybb,"My son started school in Sept, he is a young 4 (I think its far too young to start school but thats another story).

His school have all the children from 4-7 palying outside at playtime in huge grounds and they can't see what goes on with all those children.

Since Sept he has been pushed around by some of the older children, which I have reported and unfortunately they don't seem to take very seriously. I think this may be resolving itself a little now though not very sure as he won't tell me anything.

Also he has now been hit at least twice by a boy in his class. I called the boys Mum today and told her (in not accusatory manner) and asked her to see if she can find out anything from her son.

My main problem is that my DS is very timid, naive and young for his age and I don't want him to always be a pushover. How can you toughen them up a bit without telling him to hit back (don't worry I have no intention of doing that). I'm so worried about him spending his school life being pushed about.

Jan02rkc,"Sorry this is a bit of a long one!

My little one is in Reception and having no end of problems. She has consistently said that no one likes her (for quite a few months). I took this as a pinch of salt initally, but then started to come to the same conclusion. 

There's been 5/ 6 parties since September (at least), but she's not been invited to one. One girl even told her that she wasn't going to be invited (so must have come from her mum) - whereas the whole class was invited. 

We asked one girl over to go out for the afternoon, but her carer told us that she didn't think it would be appropriate, because although she really liked my daughter initally, that wasn't really the case now (?). I rang and left a message for another mother of another girl, but no response. However, I've overheard the same mother inviting other girls over etc.

She says that when she asks the other girls if she can be their friend or play with them, they just say no. 

I talked to the teacher about this a couple of months ago, but she claimed everything was OK.

Now she has well and truly stunned me. Yesterday morning she claimed that one girl had said to her: &#034;everyone hates you and your mum &#034; She wasn't upset by this comment, just repeated it very matter of factly. I asked her why, and she just said that that was what one of the girls had said. Then, before she went to bed last night she stated that the same girl had said: &#034;Everyone in your family is going to die and they'll make you die.&#034; I tried to laugh this off and play it down, but inside felt physically sick. 

I told her to tell her teacher etc if she said things like that to her. However, she said that every time she goes to tell, this girl says: &#034;sorry, sorry, don't tell.&#034;

When we went into school yesterday she went up to the girl who we tried to invite over a few weeks back, and kept trying to say hello to her. The girl just kept pretending to look the other way and refused to answer. I called her over to me and told her not to worry. She then went over to another girl and said &#034;Can I be your friend?&#034; and she just said &#034;No&#034; and walked off. Then she refused to go into class, and had to be taken in by a TA.

She has always been really well behaved in class, hardworking etc (according to her teacher), but now it seems that there are also problems with the same teacher. 2 days ago she helped in taking an item from one teacher to another (running an errand basically). However, she said that she couldn't find the teacher and so left it with the office staff (sounded like initiative to me). She was apparently told off by her teacher, informed that she was 'telling stories' and made to sit on the 'time out' mat on her own, whlle the other kids looked on. She came home and burst into tears saying: &#034;I'm a very naughty girl mummy&#034; I spoke to the TA the next day, who laughed it off saying: &#034;Oh that was all just a big misunderstanding.&#034; I asked my daughter if she'd received an apology or anything, but no, nothing has been done to rectify the situation.

Has anyone got a take on what might be going on? And what can I do about it?Sorry this is a bit of a long one!My little one is in Reception and having no end of problems. She has consistently said that no one likes her (for quite a few months). I took this as a pinch of salt initally, but then started to come to the same conclusion. There's been 5/ 6 parties since September (at least), but she's not been invited to one. One girl even told her that she wasn't going to be invited (so must have come from her mum) - whereas the whole class was invited. We asked one girl over to go out for the afternoon, but her carer told us that she didn't think it would be appropriate, because although she really liked my daughter initally, that wasn't really the case now (?). I rang and left a message for another mother of another girl, but no response. However, I've overheard the same mother inviting other girls over etc.She says that when she asks the other girls if she can be their friend or play with them, they just say no. I talked to the teacher about this a couple of months ago, but she claimed everything was OK.Now she has well and truly stunned me. Yesterday morning she claimed that one girl had said to her: ""everyone hates you and your mum""  She wasn't upset by this comment, just repeated it very matter of factly.

He is now in Year 8, and since he started secondary school, he has always had to deal with stupid remarks and name-calling about his red hair.

my son has been kicked in the head spat at punched...etc....
the teacher hasnt done anything except to put the child on a red report card!
the headmistress wont talk to me,so i got in contact with the police man whos at the school
he did a rj programme...but it didnt work.so one day after school 4 boys pushed my boy to the floor and kicked him all over. .i told the police that i wanted them charged with common assault but was told the court would throw it out of court as he wasnt harmed enough!!
i mean what would be considered as harmed enough for gods sake!!
i took my boy out of school and contacted the lea who gave me advice....ive got application forms for another school but theres no places..so now i dont know what to do.
the year 7 head contacted me to say maybe i could try to get my boy on a temporary timetable for 2 hours a day so it would keep his attendance up...
I THINK ITS TO BALANCE THEIR REGISTER......SO IT WOULDNT MAKE THEM LOOK SO BAD...
im so fed up with being fobbed off.my boy has a couple of problems...hes got a stammer which (during the summer hols was getting better) has now become so severe he cant string a sentence together...also hes got to have full frontal facial surgery to mend his jawline, which hes very worried about.
im doing this on my own as i dont want to make hubby get so involved as hes got to put up with the ranting!!! im in the process of writing a letter to the chair of governors to tell them whats going on...and ive got to appeal to the new school to hopefully get a place...

Kei25npr,"I feel ds is discriminated by his pre-school teacher and would like to hear other people's opinion. 
Me and my ds are only colored family who go to his pre-school at the moment. The staff are generally nice and caring except one staff who is a bit unfriendly to us and never makes positive comments about ds but always something negative. (such as `xx doesn't eat his lunch box well at all' etc..). Ds is very cheerful and well behaved boy (as other staff discribe) but she looks at him as if he's a bit of disturbance. That didn't bothered me much before, I just thought she's just an unfriendly person who doesn't really love children. But today when I picked ds up from pre-school that lady was handing some hand-made cakes to the kids. When ds stood in front of her for a cake, she dropped it on the floor but she didn't pick it up. So I picked the cake up from the floor and waited for her to give him another cake (I saw lots more in the kitchen) but she just bluntly said to ds`so you lost the cake then' and that's it, no `sorry' or anything. I was a bit shocked with her behaviour.
Then I went to other room to pick his coat and bag, I couldn't find his coat on usual named hook. After a little while I finally found it on the floor of the corner of the room in a messy pile. I felt a bit strange that time and when we left the pre-school that lady came up and asked if I picked his coat up (Ive never been asked that question before). I said `yes I did' and then she looked a bit puzzled and I imediately knew that she did it. 
I know I can't prove it or say for sure but I just have a feeling that there's racism going on. It's bad enough to be treated with contempt but I feel even more down when it's done by a pre-school teacher. I'm not sure what I can or should do but I don't feel comfortable to send ds to pre-school where even one staff is discriminating my child. 
Sorry for going long, hope this is just a one off thing and its my misunderstanding but just very down treated in this way....

g k67eyg,"the last two years of middle school for my son were difficult in that he was being bullied by a group of boys . They would basically get together and make fun of the way he looked or try to make him angry. I told him when they do this he should tell the teacher. Although he did this, there was not a response from the teacher until one day when my son reacted to the bullying by pushing another child and I was called at work and my son was suspended for pushing. It all didn't seem right.

Then at the end of last year, these children got a hold of our home number. They would call pretending to be one of his friends and if he got on the phone say things to upset him. We were scheduled to have a new phone system put in so I simply changed our phone number.

This year my son started high school. It was going wonderfully, so I thought. I was so happy and releaved. This year I had not given my phone number to be put in the school directory but my ex-husband had. Well, to make a long story short, my ex got hang up calls this weekend and a few calls asking for my son then hang ups. The phone number they called from is unlisted. My son revealed to me that these boys had actually resumed the bullying but he didn't say anything to me because he didn't want to stress me. One of them is the main source of agitation while the others stand around and laugh my son said. He says he just can't stand it anymore but he knows if he tells the teachers they won't do anything unless he reacts to the boys. Then he feels he will be the one who gets in trouble again.

Pau64cpz,"Am I over reacting or what??? We've just moved back to the UK from living in Spain for a few years and my son (age 10) has just started a new school....he's just told me tonight that he's being bullied by the other kids not only in his class but also from the other year groups (he's in year 6) He was diagnosed with Aspergers Syndrome a few years ago (we had to ge tthis done inBarcelona because the system here thought he was anxious about his bowel problem and I was making it worse!!! ) Don't get me wrong...his new school is a lovely school and the teachers all seem really nice ...I was very pleased when he was offered a place there at very short notice....but he is different from the other kids....1) he has long hair (none of the other boys do) 2) he has difficulty in new situations and does not mix with other people easily..especially when he does not know them..3) he does not like playing the same &#034;rough games &#034; that the other kids seem to enjoy. At the dinner table at lunch time it seems one of the boys asks everyone who does notm like my son to put their hand up...they ALL do!! This makes him feel bad but what can he do?? He is not confrontational and is a really nice and well mannered boy but he sticks out like a sore thumb when he's around more &#034;street wise&#034; kids. He is very niave in a lot of ways but is also very intelligent whilst at the same time seeming like he is not good at school work because of his difficulty writing etc. The other kids wont let him play in the yard unless he does as they say...they have also been hitting/kicking him and when he hits them back apparently one of the boys holds his arm behind his back while another kicks him and pulls his hair. Today he told me they will not even let hin help with projects in class I knlw this a long post but I am so angry and upset about it..he told me this a few hours ago and I have just stope dcrying about it all. He has never experienced this type of behaviour before..he had loads of great friends and the teachers in his last schoo were all really suportive and the only reason we have returned to England is because his &#034;father&#034; is a complete s**t and left us over a year and a half ago after a huge row....he has seen his kids twice since then and I've tried really hard to keep us in Spain but because he was so unreliable (mean!!) with the money and divorce settlement we have had to return to England. After all of this my son is now having trouble in school.It doesn't seem fair that he should put up with this and even ask me not to do anything about it because it will make it worse..he said the other kids will call him a &#034;snitch&#034; if he tells and that is worse than what is happening now. He has only been at the school a few weeks and he is already coming home with mud on his clothes from where the other boys have pushed him over him over. I am so furious that I am considering taking him out of school and home educating him...this has been talked about before but there was no need in the past because his school was so good and his friends were great!!! WHY DO SO MANY PEOPLE IN THE UK THINK THAT BULLYING IS A NORMAL PART OF GROWING UP???? It isn't!!! At least not in other places.....we have lived overseas before (in the middle east) and I can honestly say that the only place this has happened is here in England. We moved to Barcelona because I did not like the way children behaved in schools here towards children like my son. I know I'm going on a bit ans probably sound awful but this has really shaken me up after trying so hard to settle over the last few weeks. I could go on forever but I'll stop now before I sound really snooty about this:( If anyone else has had similar problems or has homeschooled a child with aspergers or similar I'd love to hear from them about how they dealt with it..at the moment I just want to protect my son from all I can and feel I am doing a really bad job of it. Going to bed now....after a cup of tea!!!! (sorry)PaulineXAm I over reacting or what??? We've just moved back to the UK from living in Spain for a few years and my son (age 10) has just started a new school....he's just told me tonight that he's being bullied by the other kids not only in his class but also from the other year groups (he's in year 6) He was diagnosed with Aspergers Syndrome a few years ago (we had to ge tthis done inBarcelona because the system here thought he was anxious about his bowel problem and I was making it worse!!![smilie=013.gif]) Don't get me wrong...his new school is a lovely school and the teachers all seem really nice ...I was very pleased when he was offered a place there at very short notice....but he is different from the other kids....1) he has long hair (none of the other boys do) 2) he has difficulty in new situations and does not mix with other people easily..especially when he does not know them..3) he does not like playing the same ""rough games "" that the other kids seem to enjoy. At the dinner table at lunch time it seems one of the boys asks everyone who does notm like my son to put their hand up...they ALL do!! This makes him feel bad but what can he do?? He is not confrontational and is a really nice and well mannered boy but he sticks out like a sore thumb when he's around more ""street wise"" kids. He is very niave in a lot of ways but is also very intelligent whilst at the same time seeming like he is not good at school work because of his difficulty writing etc. The other kids wont let him play in the yard unless he does as they say...they have also been hitting/kicking him and when he hits them back apparently one of the boys holds his arm behind his back while another kicks him and pulls his hair. Today he told me they will not even let hin help with projects in class[smilie=013.gif] I knlw this a  long post but I am so angry and upset about it..he told me this a few hours ago and I have just stope dcrying about it all. He has never experienced this type of behaviour before..he had loads of great friends and the teachers in his last schoo were all really suportive and the only reason we have returned to England is because his ""father"" is a complete s**t and left us over a year and a half ago after a huge row....he has seen his kids twice since then and I've tried really hard to keep us in Spain but because he was so unreliable (mean!!) with the money and divorce settlement we have had to return to England. After all of this my son is now having trouble in school.It doesn't seem fair that he should put up with this and even ask me not to do anything about it because it will make it worse..he said the other kids will call him a ""snitch"" if he tells and that is worse than what is happening now. He has only been at the school a few weeks and he is already coming home with mud on his clothes from where the other boys have pushed him over him over. I am so furious that I am considering taking him out of school and home educating him...this has been talked about before but there was no need in the past because his school was so good and his friends were great!!! WHY DO SO MANY PEOPLE IN THE UK THINK THAT BULLYING IS A NORMAL PART OF GROWING UP???? It isn't!!! At least not in other places.....we have lived overseas before (in the middle east) and I can honestly say that the only place this has happened is here in England. We moved to Barcelona because I did not like the way children behaved in schools here towards children like my son. I know I'm going on a bit ans probably sound awful but this has really shaken me up after trying so hard to settle over the last few weeks.

Trouble is,i dont want to keep going in at every little thing,but the teachers are not made aware of every little kick or punch when it happens,or sometimes the child fails to even report it and it goes unnoted.I have started keeping a log but it is difficult as not everything gets back to me correctly or at all.i dont want N to suffer in this way,and find it difficult to find the words to re assure him that it will be ok.he has just started year two and i dont want this boy to continue hassling him and making his life miserable in an otherwise good and happy school environment.Please help!Hi, its not even the end of the first week back and already my son has come back miserable complaining every day this week that one particular boy has continued to bully him.This was a problem last school year and not just with us, other mums have had problems too with him.I have taken it up with the class teacher last year and the head who were very reassuring at the time that they were keeping a close eye on the situation.Trouble is,i dont want to keep going in at every little thing,but the teachers are not made aware of every little kick or punch when it happens,or sometimes the child fails to even report it and it goes unnoted.I  have started keeping a log but it is difficult as not everything gets back to me correctly or at all.i dont want N to suffer in this way,and find it difficult to find the words to re assure him that it will be ok.he has just started year two and i dont want this boy to continue hassling him and making his life miserable in an otherwise good and happy school environment.Please help!",8,"1,644", 06-09-2007 at 11.27PM

I dont know if anybody is interested, but I got a free book from the Home Office and its aimed at young children to encourage them to say if they're being bullied, if someone wants them to keep a secret etc. 
If you ring the Home Office on 0207 035 4848 and quote code NNB04, they will send you as many copies as you want. 
My ds's playschool has just ordered them too to give out to all the kids.

Don42ddq,"Hey every1,
Some of you are probably gonna go mad when you have read this but here goes.....
I started a new school half way through the year when i was 13.
This girl started bullying me from day 1. The teachers took no notice and when something did get said to her, she would be even worse. It was physical and emotionally bullying that went on for nearly 2 years. Anyways 1 day i had just had enough and i retaliated (sp) and i hit her, more than once. After this, she never bullied me again and in fact tried to be friends with me. I know this was probably wrong but it worked!
If my daughter was ever in the same situation, say if some1 hit her, id always tell her to hit them back. Yeah i know, 2 wrongs dont make a right. What im getting at is.....what would you say to your child if they were getting bullied, hit etc at school.

Kat11osx,"Hi there,

Like many people who post in this section of the forum I was bullied for many years. I think this was mainly due to the fact that I am 'sensitive' and unfortunately bullies have a sixth sense to pick out those who are easy targets. My children (ds particularly) are exactly the same as I was (and still am I suppose). Because of my situation at home it was unlikely that I would have ever have much confidence in myself but I am wondering if anyone has any tips on teaching my children how to feel confident within themselves. 

I don't think they suffer with any problems with self-esteem but are still giving off the same sensitive vibe that I always did. It's not that I want to get rid of that particularly but for them to also have an inner-confidence that protects them. 

How do you teach your children to deal with those who are agressive or bullying? I have to say that considering the anti-bullying policies in the schools I went to actually made things worse, I would be tempted to tell them to give as good as they get because in my experience nothing else works. I don't necessarily mean this in a physical sense but more verbally. For example, shouting at a child who it taunting you to leave you alone. This might be frowned upon but if either of my children were being physically attacked and couldn't see or shout for an adult I would tell them to fight back (in fact part of me is tempted to tell them to do that anyway, even though I know it is wrong :( ). I'm generally quite balanced but because I try not to think about what happened to me, I find that my views are quite extreme and I guess I'm trying to find out exactly what the middle ground is. Have things changed for the better since we were at school?

Sorry if I sound a bit cold and hard - I find this quite hard to talk about.

Mel21zuu,"Hi,

I've not posted before, but have been a member for ages!

My daughter has just tuned 6 and is in year 1 at school. A couple of months ago i noticed a change in her behaviour, she began being extremely rude to me and hubbie and obnoxious towards her 2 sisters (4yrs &amp; 1yr) Her behaviour went from wonderful friendly and helpful to completely the opposite. I just thought it was a stage that she was going through until she started making herself sick and saying she was fat!

Of course alarm bells started ringing.....I sat her down and had a long chat with her about it and asked if everything was okay, what was wrong etc. The following week she started complaining about going to school, she wouldn't get out of bed and when i would eventually get her out of bed she would tell me she was going to be sick, to which i said if she made herself sick anymore i would be cross and that she would still be going to school. She got herself in a right pickle screaming and yelling so i kept her off school and took her to see our GP. She told him some things about being picked on at school, and he said that her being sick does not relate to her thoughts of being fat, as she would not understand that. Her being sick is so that she can stay off school because of bullies.

I went directly from the dr's to see the headmistress who seemed to be lovely and would speak to the children in question and to my daughter. When my daughter came home she told me that the head had spoken to her but would not discuss with me as to what had been said and promptly told me that she felt sick!

Anyway on Friday, the head came over to me after school and in front of my daughter asked how things were, not wanting to talk in front of my daughter i just replied worse at home, she continued on to say that everything was fine at school and there was no problem with bullying and as my daughter is the eldest of 3 may she suggest that perhaps i spend a bit more quality time with her!!!!! This enraged me as 1. how dare she and 2. how unproffesional to speak to me like that in front of my kids!!!!!

I now have a meeting this afternoon with her and hubbie can't come with me and am very scared about what to say!

my daughter is 12 ( but a very young 12 compared to the other city girls at her school) and she has alot of problems physical with her legs and also dyslexia nad dyspria so she struggles with new things and making new friends etc
we moved from a village in wales and so she has been in a city for only 7 months and getting use to it slowly.
two girls at school gang up very badly at school eg
one is her friends and slags off the other then shell go back to the other girl and say tiff said it all and she says loads more ( im not a mum who believes my daughter is perfect as i know she isnt but she hasnt got a cruel bone in her body and just tends to go along with what is said)
so they destroyed her school jumper cutting it up in front of her, telling lies that she stole items from one of the girls house 4 months ago when she went there and that the police were getting involved etc..... you can image the things they say names calling etc

so i phoned school and spoke to class assistant who said its sorted out.... so i said ok ill leave it at that
2 weeks later tiff came home in tears again they were starting on her again telling other kids not to talk to tiff etc , they hate her as she has freckles , she smells etc 
so i phoned the school again and spoke to head of year she promised she would deal with it and gave the girls a dentioion and said stay away from each other.
of course it started again so i phoned one of the girls dads this time and said look there are rumours going round tiffany stole a ring from your house and u were calling the police etc and what exactly was the story 
he was furrious with his daughter that she had been bullying tiffany and the threats etc and said hed deal with his daughter and he was so sorry etc. his daughter then said sorry to tiff .
tiffany then stayed off school as she was scared of what would happen with the two girls afterwards and is scared to go back to school in september now and she is working herself up into such a state she is sick, having astma attacks and faking sickness etc despite it being 6 weeks away before school starts
did i do the rite thing talking to one of the dads?
also the school demanding this is dealt with ( i dont believe my daughter is totally innocent and i said that to both)

This ranges from the youngest (3yo boy) biting and hitting to the other two older siblings being nasty, saying things like “you’re not to play with us”, “don’t touch my toy” &amp; “don’t go near our garden”.

Unfortunately my DS seems to have 90% of it directed towards him. He use to just curl up in a ball and cry but he is toughening up a bit now. I tell him to tell them to stop being nasty and go &amp; play with the other kids – but he keeps wanting to still play with them as he says they are most fun to play with. 

Their mother does try to step in and tell them off. But I know that at home they are just allowed to get on with it. As she has told me that this is just how kids are and they should be just left to get on with it. She is also aware that kids seem to have a sixth sense and home-in on the vulnerable ones. She is aware that her kids are specifically targeting my son. She is also a child minder and has commented on how her kids tend to gang up on another small boy she look after that has learning difficulties. 

My son seems to be upset at the time but otherwise it does not bother him too much. I think I get more upset by it than he does. An example of what is happening is as follows……
Last night we were all making our way in and my son was having a sulk with me because he didn’t want to go in. So he started walking off in the opposite direction towards a manhole cover on the green that he usually sits on. This manhole cover is a few meters away from the back gate of this family’s garden. The eldest (6yo boy) shouted to him that he was not to go into their garden. (he has no intentions of doing this – he was just sulking sat on the manhole cover). I explained to him that my DS was not going anywhere near their garden and that he was just sitting on the manhole cover. Then the middle child (4yo girl) shouted at my DS asking him why he was going to go into their garden. And the other sibling again backed his sister up saying “yeah – don’t go in it”. All of this is happening just 3 or 4 feet away from me. Their mother doesn’t say a thing and I’m so gobsmaked that these kids believe it is acceptable behaviour to do this and especially right in front of me – that I can’t get a word out. 

If I were to behave in this way when I was younger, I would have been smacked and sent directly to bed – I would never have spoken to people in this way – especially in front of their parents. 

I’m sure my son is not perfect either. But when this family are not around all the other children play together beautifully. 

So my question is……… Am I being overly sensitive as this is just what kids do or am I right and should try to sort it out? 

I’m so sorry that this has been so long and thank you for bearing with me and reading this.

Ann95mxq,"Hi,
my nighbor does not like my husband playing Cello. This was a big issue when we first moved into our flat. After about 8 months of supporting his abusive behaviour which we tried to ignore we told our landlord who was able to interfere. We found an agreement that my husband would only play in one designated room and only at &#034;normal&#034; times in the day. Last Saturday, my husband played the Cello at 9:30 in the morning (as on many other Saturdays before) in the the usual room. Within 10 minute this neighbor was ringing the doorbell permanently, even putting tape over it, so it continued to ring. Later on he banged against the ceiling, was verbally aggressive to me and our 2 1/2 year old girl and last night he rang the doorbell at 2:45 am and 3:10 am. When I came home from work today he was spotting me from his window and said he would make our life a misery. What can I do? So far we have ignored his behaviour, deconected the doorbell and sent a letter to the landlord. Tonight he plays the radio so loud below our daughter's bedroom that I put her to sleep in a travelcot in our room.
Any advice?

Deleted profile,"Hi all

I am a mom and a teacher advisor for children who are in care now but was a primary school teacher for years before that.

As part of both jobs I was heavily involved in anti bullying strategies at school and spoke at the DFES Antibullying Conference in Birmingham a couple of years ago.

I can suggest many strategies in which schools and other groups can deal with bullying and childrens emotional literacy and esteem but I was just wondering how many of you know anything about one particular scheme called Protective Behaviours - or PBs as we call it. I have taught PBs to countless kids and I believe that it really helps children to keep themselves feeling safe and encourages them to speak to people if they are being bullied.

This is achieved by helping them to recognise and understand feelings, recognise what feeling safe is and recognise and trust their intuitive feelings that they may get when they do not feel so safe (early warning signs). It encourages them to approach carefully chosen people for help and support and helps them to develop strategies for self-protection. It can be done with children or even adults of any age and in school and at home.

I am in the lucky position of actually knowing people who run and are part of the UK Charity who organise and teach about Protective Behaviours in the UK. I have no vested interest in their work - I just use PBs a lot and have seen the benefits that it can hold. 

If any of you use PBs or would like to know more about it feel free to shout..

Claire E(16),"I was bullied when I was nine. I went from a state school to a private school and the girls were really horrible to me. My hair was a bit greasy one day and they said it looked like a brillo pad and loads of them were all calling me names in the play ground.

I cant remember now how it really happened but I can remember how I felt.

I had a terrible year that year and was also badly bitten by our family dog. I often wonder whether this has really affected me because I am very insecure in friendships and often think that I cant trust friends or female family members.

I think it is so important that this is stopped as much as possible for young people and I think it is terrible that some are so depressed that they kill themselves.

I would love to find a way to help young people that are bullied.

lis21ubu,":( hi my daughter is 10 years old and a very socialable little girl that just wants to make some friends.
since being here nearly four years i find that she has found it very difficult to make friends around where we live aswell as the school through other children being very nasty to her and bully her. im so sad for her because she can be a sweet little girl.
 where she goes to school the children are so nasty to her there was an incident where she was in the library with three girls sorting books out and they ganged up on her and shuved a trolly into her. i spoke to the head teacher and she got all of us together for them to apologise and said she would get letters sent home well it never happened and what disgused me was one got a certificate on the friday for good work.
well that anoyed me deeply.
 theres other incidents where children are rude to her and swear at her and say that noone likes her in the school well how hurtful is that. my poor little girl has to put up with that she will tell the teacher but what happens is not alot. shes been having problems with one boy in the class where he swears and has punched her in the stomache before but he goes to the head and it just gets marked down he didnt get a letter for it. i feel that the bullyin is getting out of hand because something has seriously happend now and i cant take it anymore.
 she said that she had some emails sent to her on her school email saying hes gonna kill her and shes a twat now theres many so i have been to the school about it. oh yer they have printed them off and theres going to be a meeting with me an the parents but thats not enough i feel that my daughter has been terrorised. i cannot even put her in another school as we live in a village so its the only school near i feel like i have failed as a parent and theres nothing i can do. i feel its all my fault as before we come here she had a load of friends in her school and now she dont have any. hi my daughter is 10 years old and a very socialable little girl that just wants to make some friends.since being here nearly four years i find that she has found it very difficult to make friends around where we live aswell as the school through other children being very nasty to her and bully her. im so sad for her because she can be a sweet little girl. where she goes to school the children are so nasty to her there was an incident where she was in the library with three girls sorting books out and they ganged up on her and shuved a trolly into her. i spoke to the head teacher and she got all of us together for them to apologise and said she would get letters sent home well it never happened and what disgused me was one got a certificate on the friday for good work.well that anoyed me deeply. theres other incidents where children are rude to her and swear at her and say that noone likes her in the school well how hurtful is that. my poor little girl has to put up with that she will tell the teacher but what happens is not alot. shes been having problems with one boy in the class where he swears and has punched her in the stomache before but he goes to the head and it just gets marked down he didnt get a letter for it. i feel that the bullyin is getting out of hand because something has seriously happend now and i cant take it anymore. she said that she had some emails sent to her on her school email saying hes gonna kill her and shes a twat now theres many so i have been to the school about it. oh yer they have printed them off and theres going to be a meeting with me an the parents but thats not enough i feel that my daughter has been terrorised. i cannot even put her in another school as we live in a village so its the only school near i feel like i have failed as a parent and theres nothing i can do. i feel its all my fault as before we come here she had a load of friends in her school and now she dont have any.",3,"3,598", 20-05-2007 at 7.03PM  
Deleted profile,"I am new to all this but am at my wits end so could do with some outside advice!

I have an almost 10 year old and an almost three year old (in a couple of days!). My LO is so placid and a lovely little girl, she has a tantrum every so often but only really when she is tired or someone takes her favourite toy, the rest of the time she is perfect. My hubby is away a lot with work so its usually just me and the girls. Where we live there is a little boy who lives real close to us who is 2 months younger than her that smacks, bites, kicks, hits her with toys, punches pretty much anything he feels like doing, to my little princess. The problem is it has been going on now for a year and a half! I have spoken to the mother (who is a friend, or used to be!) numerous times and she is very flippant about it, she cant be bothered to deal with him yet if anyone elses child even says no to hers she tells them off!! Many times he has bitten my LO or drawn blood and the mother says &#034;that is naughty, behave&#034; then gives him chocolate cake or a cuddle or something! He pushed her off the top of a 5' slide and she just said &#034;i give up with him, what am i supposed to do?&#034; and did nothing yet when we offer answers ie naughty step etc she doesnt bother. 

More and more lately she has been lying for him for example all the kids were playing out the front and he went to take my LO's new pushchair from her (no chance!), a minute later me and another lady saw him leg it round the corner at the same time my LO started crying. I asked whats wrong and she said &#034;**** has just hit me in the eye&#034;. The mother said he didnt because hes round the corner! The other lady said, &#034;he ran round the corner after&#034;! Also last week, playing out front again I watched him go near my LO and then bite her. I shouted &#034;***** get off her&#034; and the mother said &#034;he bit her because she bit him first&#034;, I said &#034;no way, I was just watching them the whole time&#034;, she had been in her house so how would she know! plus he bites her all the time and she has NEVER retaliated in any form! Sometimes he even comes in grinning saying &#034;i just hit *****! The mother just tells him to behave and leaves him to it. Im really fed up with it, i find im staying in so LO doesnt go near him and my hubby and I have even got DD a place in a school 6 miles away so she wont be in Nursery with him. Last week he pushed her over 3 times without the mother saying anything then hit a friends little girl and the mother said he didnt when I had seen him so I told my LO to hit him back now. I know its not the right thing to do but I dont know what else to do to stop her being bullied by him. I cant cope with it anymore, my hubby is always away, i suffer from seizures brought on by stress and have two children to look after as well as running a Moms and tots group! Please help, these are a tiny amount of the things he has done! I feel like I hate him now and the mother and I used to be close but now I dont want to be near her either as it feels like shes allowing him to bully my DD. :( Thank you.I am new to all this but am at my wits end so could do with some outside advice!I have an almost 10 year old and an almost three year old (in a couple of days!).  My LO is so placid and a lovely little girl, she has a tantrum every so often but only really when she is tired or someone takes her favourite toy, the rest of the time she is perfect.  My hubby is away a lot with work so its usually just me and the girls.  Where we live there is a little boy who lives real close to us who is 2 months younger than her that smacks, bites, kicks, hits her with toys, punches pretty much anything he feels like doing, to my little princess.  The problem is it has been going on now for a year and a half!  I have spoken to the mother (who is a friend, or used to be!) numerous times and she is very flippant about it, she cant be bothered to deal with him yet if anyone elses child even says no to hers she tells them off!!  Many times he has bitten my LO or drawn blood and the mother says ""that is naughty, behave"" then gives him chocolate cake or a cuddle or something!

My daughter is only just 8 and has already had her first taster of this 'vile' sign of our times. 

My daughter is a confident, funny, friendly girl - and she turned into a shadow of herself who cried all the time and just couldnt understand why this was happening. This bullying started after some really painful emotional months for our family, so my daughter really wasnt equipped to deal with anymore of a battering.

I tried to help my daughter deal with it herself, by coaching her with suggestions of saying loudly 'stop leaving me out of the game' or 'stop saying horrid things' and so on, with the idea being it would alert the teachers at the time things were happening. This went on for about a month, and it didnt help - as when the situations happened, she had no gumption left to deliver these loud statements.

And the old trick, the bully claimed to be the bullied! (And yes, I was wise enough to question my daughter - something I later felt terrible about as it made her feel i doubted her, which in my heart i didnt).

After considering all sorts of horrid tactics, i decided to take the intelligent route - the school claimed no bullying was occurring and it was 6 of one half a dozen of the other (the invisible crimes of bullying! - isolation being the strongest weapon).

In the end, armed with all the resolve and self control i had left, I went to the school and proposed a 'positive emotions diary' be imposed on both my daughter and the bully - a book they had to fill in every day. Thus making them both have to look for positive reasons about interacting with one and other - the problem stopped within days!

I appreciate this will only work on children up to a certain age - but none the less is a worthwhile tool.

We never found out who the ultimate bully was, but by this stage I only cared that two very young girls were unhappy (my priority being my daughter), and that had been resolved by means of a £2 note book each and a few minutes set aside each day to be constructive rather than destructive toward and about each other.

 I worked in a hospital setting for 8 years the last five had been hell, all beacuse I had a baby and was attending university because I was redeployed.

Lee48xkb,"Hi

I am not sure if it qualifies as bullying, but my DD (3) is being 'picked on' at nursery. There is a little girl there who is a few months younger than her who is constantly hitting and smacking my DD.

I have spoken to nursery about it and they are 'monitoring the situation' but I am getting a little peeved about it as its being going on since before xmas. my DD is still happy going to nursery and the other girls parents have been told, but there has been no improvement.... 

Should I leave it or say something??

ali18mey,"i was talking to my friend the other day and she was telling me that a boy at her DD school was bullying her she is only 6 anyway she has spoken to that teacher,s load,s about this but the last straw came last week 

she was in bed and it was about 2am she could here someone walking around but she thought it was her brother who is staying with them but she then heard a slab outside her front door go (make,s a loud bag when you step on it) so she jumped out of bed got half way downstair,s and saw her DD come in the front door :shock: she somehow unlocked the front door went outside walked down the road but came back 

when my friend asked what the heck she was playing at she said the boy at school told her that when its dark she must walk to the school and climb a tree with him :shock: my friend left it that night and put her back to bed she stayed awake all night incase she tryed it again thankfully she never

anyway morning came and she asked her DD why she wanted to lieve and she told her about the boy telling her to do it or he will hurt her and take all her friends away and how she is really scard of him and thought if she did not listen to him he would hurt her he also told 3 other kid,s to do this

when they went to school that morning my friend told he teacher about what happend and all the teacher said is I WILL HAVE A WORD WITH HIM :shock: after school she spoke to the teacher again who said she spoke to the boy who said he never but the other 3 kids said he did tell them to meet him at the school awell 

but what,s really peed my friend off is anything could of happend to her DD and that the boy should of had more then a word he has been picking on her for week,s the only reason she came back in that night was because she said it was to cold and scary out there 

i just hope they do something because he got really annoyed that she told on him so what will he do next to her she is such a sweet girl and will do anything for anyone 

how do 6-7 year old,s get power over someone like this my friend did explain to her that anything could of happend to her she could of been nocked by a car or a bad man could of taken her but what really made my friend cry was she said what if she never heard her and she did walk to the school and when my friend went it to wake her that morning she was,ent there she would of had no idea where she could of gonei was talking to my friend the other day and she was telling me that a boy at her DD school was bullying her she is only 6 anyway she has spoken to that teacher,s load,s about this but the last straw came last week she was in bed and it was about 2am she could here someone walking around but she thought it was her brother who is staying with them but she then heard a slab outside her front door go (make,s a loud bag when you step on it) so she jumped out of bed got half way downstair,s and saw her DD come in the front door  she somehow unlocked the front door went outside walked down the road but came back when my friend asked what the heck she was playing at she said the boy at school told her that when its dark she must walk to the school and climb a tree with him  my friend left it that night and put her back to bed she stayed awake all night incase she tryed it again thankfully she neveranyway morning came and she asked her DD why she wanted to lieve and she told her about the boy telling her to do it or he will hurt her and take all her friends away and how she is really scard of him and thought if she did not listen to him he would hurt her he also told 3 other kid,s to do thiswhen they went to school that morning my friend told he teacher about what happend and all the teacher said is I WILL HAVE A WORD WITH HIM  after school she spoke to the teacher again who said she spoke to the boy who said he never but the other 3 kids said he did tell them to meet him at the school awell but what,s really peed my friend off is anything could of happend to her DD and that the boy should of had more then a word he has been picking on her for week,s the only reason she came back in that night was because she said it was to cold and scary out there i just hope they do something because he got really annoyed that she told on him so what will he do next to her she is such a sweet girl and will do anything for anyone how do 6-7 year old,s get power over someone like this my friend did explain to her that anything could of happend to her she could of been nocked by a car or a bad man could of taken her but what really made my friend cry was she said what if she never heard her and she did walk to the school and when my friend went it to wake her that morning she was,ent there she would of had no idea where she could of gone",15,"2,119", 05-03-2007 at 10.01PM

I as for some advice on my 10 yr old sons behaviour a while back with lots of response, which helped.
However for the last couple of weeks he been coming home with brusies, not little ones but great big things.
The behaviour has been really bad at home to the point where I was ready to take him to social services and leave him there :oops:, please don't think I that horrible as I usually really laid back.
Any way he wouldn't get up this morning and come out that he being bullied by a boy that I have been in about on numerous occasions.
Head teacher almost called my son a liar, although I have taken him in today to show the bruises.
He told me to make him come back to school, however its come out tonight he was demanding money off my son, and during the hot weather money he was getting for water this boy was taking so he wasnt even having a drink all day.
His kept this to himself for mnths and I feel rotten for not picking up on it.
School arnt listening and I don't want to send him back, what would you all do ?.
well if you are here well done for getting there, just don't know what to do.
Many thanks in advance.

chr64qnp,"Hi, having read the posts about bullying, I just wanted to join in the discussion and tell my story, bare with me, it's a long one!!!

My daughter, aged 12, was bullied for the final year at her Primary school. I feel that this was caused by the School moving her out of her usual group of friends and classmates, who she had grown up with for over 6 years. The school decided that as my dd, was popular, friendly, outgoing and also the brightest of her year, that she would be able to adapt to the new class. How wrong they were! She felt isolated and was ignored by the other girls in the class, who had obviously formed their own little friendship groups and did'nt want my dd to join theirs....a bit like the mum's in the playground, who are so clicky and won't let anyone else join them!! My dd asked the teacher after 2 weeks, if she could go back to her old class, the teacher refused. The girls in her class became resentful, because my dd is brighter than they were (sorry, I hope this doesn't sound like I'm boasting, but her SAT results were always the highest score in her year). They would not talk to her, yet talked about her. They would not play with her at break time.....my dd requested that she could at least play with her other friends at break time, who were on a different part of the playground...again the teacher refused. 

 Her school work deteriorated. The teacher would write silly comments on her homework...&#034;you can do better than this&#034;.......
My dd started to hate going to school, faking illness, becoming moody. Then one day she told me that she was being bullied. I went to the school and made a complaint...it happened again and again and again. My dd would break down in the classroom...the teacher would take her outside and give her a friendly' don't worry' type chat, then send dd back in the class.

The whole thing escalated, again I would go in to the school, again, they would tell me they would keep an eye on her. 

One day as I was cleaning out her bedroom, I found her diary. I sat down on her bed and read it....by the time I had finished reading, my heart was in my mouth and I was crying. My dd had never told me half of what was really going on at school. My beautiful, intelligent child had wrote how the girls would call her names, poke her, crowd around her at playtime and push her and name call, they ignored her in class and wouldn't let her do group work with them. My daughter also wrote how she was self harming, to make her feel better!! She was 11 years old.

I didn't know what else to do....the school, just did not want to act on the bullying. Why? Do the teachers and the Head, not realise that just because a child is under 13, that the bullying is not serious? Do they honestly think that it comes under the category of children being spiteful. How do they know the difference between spiteful or bullying? 


My main fear now was that these girls will also be attending the same Senior school as my dd. I couldn't bare the thought of this bullying continuing After posting a message on Netmums, a lovely lady advised me to contact the Head of the Senior school and request that my dd was placed into a diferent form class to these girls. I named each of the bullies. I then went back to my dd's teacher at Primary school and told her what I had done....her shocked expression is one that I shall always remember. I told her that I was not happy with the way she and the school had dealt with the bullying and that they had failed to protect my daughter.! 

My daughter is in a different form class to the bullies. And after 6 weeks of me 'brainwashing' her, during the summer holidays, has now learnt to stand up to these nasty girls. I told her that if they push you, you push back. If they say anything to you, say something nasty back. Do not be a doormat....I know that the rule is, don't get into a fight, just ignore the bullies, but in all honesty, if your child doesn't retaliate, then surely the bullies are winning. They won for a whole year at Primary school. We all know that the schools DO NOT address bullying, we all know that 9 times out of ten the bully gets away with it. The situation in schools today, is far worse than when we were at school. There needs to be some form of punishment available for schools to hand out to bullies. Teachers need to be re-trained in recognising victims of bullying. Surely, if a child requests that they are put in a different class, this should let the teacher know that something is going on, that the pupil is unhappy . If a pupil breaks down in tears during a lesson....again, something is not right,something is going on that they are not aware of. 

Schools MUST take responsibilty for what is going on in their classrooms. Never mind if expelling a child, leaves a blot on their prospectus, they need to act on bullying as soon as it rears it's ugly head.Hi, having read the posts about bullying, I just wanted to join in the discussion and tell my story, bare with me, it's a long one!!!My daughter, aged 12, was bullied for the final year at her Primary school.  I feel that this was caused by the School moving her out of her usual group of friends and classmates, who she had grown up with for over 6 years.

I did not know that she was being bullied to start with (age 4) because she couldn't express herself very well.It sarted off with her wetting the bed and then gradually not wanting to go to school.She couldn't tell us why she didn't want to go and the teacher used to say there is no problem she is fine in school.So we believed it.Then she would start coming home with her lunch saying she was not hungry and this turned out to be because people were horrible to her in the canteen.She never went in the canteen but hid behind the classrooms instead.Gradually she got so bad that she was having nightmares ,wetting the bed and self harming ie picking her skin until it bled.She would cry because she was so sore but she couldn't stop.She had no toenails left either.At about 8yrs old she had a nervous breakdown.I only found out she was unhappy at school was because a classroom assistant took me to one side and asked why my daughter was so unhappy and she told me a few things that went on but asked me to not let on she had told me.
To cut a very long story short she is now in her fourth school and her needs are being met but it has taken a few years to get things right.
She has never had a close friend,never been invited to anyones house and gets left out of parties etc.
She has not had a birthday party either since starting school because she always says &#034;i doubt in anyone will turn up&#034;.I dread her birthday every year.
She is extremley lonley.
I too have suffered depression because of this.
The teacher ,lea ,mp ect were useless.
Even went to the local papers.
Anti bullying policies are not worth the paper they are written on.

Today he went on his first school trip to London (he is only 5) and he tells me he sat on the bus on his own as no one wanted to be his partner, its breaking my heart as he is such a lovely boy and I know he is really hurt by all this, what should I do?My son is in year 1 at school and we have been concerned since he started that he has not made any friends indeed it was very hard for us at first to even get him to go to school, but we put it down to it being a large noisy class.  We have been assured along the way that all is fine and that children take time to make friends, but the stuff my son tells of children hitting him even girls makes me think different.  Today he went on his first school trip to London (he is only 5) and he tells me he sat on the bus on his own as no one wanted to be his partner, its breaking my heart as he is such a lovely boy and I know he is really hurt by all this, what should I do?",2,"1,814", 15-11-2006 at 10.45PM  
Cla05rcp,"I am not sure whether my dd and ds are being bullied at nursery. 

I know this may sound a bit strange but my ds has suddenly started baby swearing (stinky bum and poo poo). Of course when he says it we tell him off and have to walk out of the room because he's only 2 1/2 and to hear him say it is quite funny. We have managed to stamp it out at home (although I did hear him saying it this morning!) We asked nursery and my dd (nearly 4) about it. My dd said that two boys said it at nursery (dd and ds are in the same room) and that one of these boys was mean to ds. Nursery said that one of the boys had brought it in from home and it was spreading through the whole of the nursery (well those who could speak anyway!). They were trying to stop it as well. After my dd telling us that one of the boys was mean to ds we kept an eye out, she also said that he was mean to her and the other children as well. Over the past week (now that we are aware of it we are noticing it) this particular boy has run up to dd and ds every morning when they get in. He tried to take a toy from dd who stood up to him. She's older than he is. He did try to barge her out of the way though, dh told him politly that it wasn't very nice. Nursery said nothing! This morning it was me taking them into nursery (it's more often than not dh because of work commitments so he sees it more). Dh had given them crisps this morning (great for toddlers!! I did point that out to him! lol). I made them eat them outside of nursery before going in because I didn't want nursery to have a problem with cleaning it up etc etc. (There have been loads of notices about breakfast at nursery.) Anyway, this boy saw ds and dd with the crisps on his way in. When ds got into the classroom this morning this boy came up and asked him where his crisps were and asked him if he had them all in his tummy, he jabbed him in the tummy when he was saying this. Ds was backing away so I told my ds to take his bag to his peg for me and this boy went off. Dh has told me on a few occasions that ds has backed away from this boy as he gets very close and is quite rough. Ds is the youngest in the room and dd is the eldest.

We spoke to someone who is a friend of ours from nursery who looks after them and she said that ds does stand up for himself but so far we have not seen this. We are quite worried about it. DH has told this boy off 3 times now when he has been dropping off or picking up and I have tried to move my children out of his way when I get there and he troubles them. Nursery have only said something once to him while we have been there. Dd and ds make no more fuss about going into nursery than they ever did and they went in quite happily this morning. 

Dh and I spoke about this on the evening that dd told us about it. Dh was bullied badly at school so I thought that perhaps he was a little oversensitive about it. I thought that it was just kids. Our ds is not gentle by any means and could just knock this boy over if he wanted. Ds can be a bit shy to start with but then gets better after a few minutes. Basically my question is, do you think that this is something we should be worried about or do you think that it's just happening because ds is a bit shy to start with?I am not sure whether my dd and ds are being bullied at nursery.
